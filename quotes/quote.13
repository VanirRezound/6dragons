The Great Laws of the Coven

Law #5
"No vampire shall ever reveal his true nature to a mortal and allow that mortal to live. No vampire must ever reveal the history of  vampires to a mortal and let that mortal live. No vampire may commit to writing the history of vampires. A vampire's name must never be known by mortals."

 -- Armand's memory, from Anne Rice's novel 'The Vampire Lestat'.
