The Great Laws of the Coven

Law #4
"No vampire may ever destroy another vampire, except that the coven master has the power of life and death over all his flock. And it is further his obligation to lead the old ones and the mad ones into the fire when they can no longer serve as they should. It is his obligation to destroy all vampires who are not properly made. It is his obligation to destroy all thoses who are so badly wounded that they cannot survive on their own. And it is his obligation finally to seek the destruction of all outcasts and all who have broken the laws."

 -- Armand's memory, from Anne Rice's novel 'The Vampire Lestat'.
