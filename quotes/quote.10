The Great Laws of the Coven

Law #2
"The Dark Gift must never be given to the crippled, the maimed, or to children, or to those who cannot, even with the Dark Powers, survive on their own. Be it further understood that all mortals who would receive the Dark Gift should be beautiful in person, so that the insult to the Creator might be greater when the Dark Trick is done."

 -- Armand's memory, from Anne Rice's novel 'The Vampire Lestat'.
