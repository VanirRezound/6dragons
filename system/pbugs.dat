BugDesc       failure when forging ore destroys all of your ore as opposed to just the 
one you were working on (all in inventory) 
----------------------
&GEdit by Aurin: Why not make the first attempt 100% success
rate, so that this is no longer a concern?  I'm fairly
confident I can do this. heh

BugDesc       Hello, For some reason druids can only be first or third classes. I I have 
tried different races with the same results. Fyndarwyn 

---Comment by Garick---
Wasn't sure if this was actually a bug or not, but it sounded suspect. Went ahead and told him to send it up to one of you coder-folk.

BugDesc       In regards to bug 10, Druid cannot be chosen as a second class during 
character creation. It is prevented in genesis.c at line 217 through 
mutually exclusive if statements for CLASS_DRUID and CLASS_PRIEST. I tried 
for several hours to get it to both show up as a second class choice, 
while remaining mutually exclusive. I couldn't get it to do this, perhaps 
someone else can. heh If/when this is fixed, would appreciate knowing how 
it was done so that I'll know for next time. heh 

Cheers,
Aurin

BugDesc       interesting thing here: mob was found to be at -22 hp, but not dead. could 
not kill. position of 0. had to set to pos 1 so that Aeliana could finish 
off the mob. heh perhaps there should be a check to auto-correct this if 
it should happen again?

BugDesc       I keep auto dropping all of my equipment and gear when
i kill a mob.  doesnt seem to matter if its good evil
I have tried several areas and same result.
Its very varied, and strange.  Emily opinioned that
it might be a problem with bag space.
