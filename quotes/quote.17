Aragorn: "Gentlemen! We do not stop until nightfall."
Pippin: "But what about breakfast?"
Aragorn: "You've already had it."
Pippin: "We've had one, yes. But what about second breakfast?"
[Aragorn stares at him, then walks away.]
Merry: "Don't think he knows about second breakfast, Pip."
Pippin: "What about elevensies? Luncheon? Afternoon tea? Dinner? Supper? He knows about them, doesn't he?"
Merry: "Wouldn't count on it."
