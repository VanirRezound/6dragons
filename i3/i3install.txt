Terms of Use

------------



1. You may use this snippet in your code provided that any included

comment headers in the code are left intact. You may add your own, but

do not take mine out.



2. This snippet may not be posted for redistribution on any site

without obtaining prior written consent from the Alsherok team.



3. You must ALSO comply with the terms of the LICENSE file as well since this

work was derived from the code covered by that license.



If you can't agree to these terms, don't use this code, and don't expect

me to help if something breaks while installing it. Harsh? Hardly. I'm

tired of people who come crawling to whine and complain when they haven't

bothered to comply with the terms first.



What this code does

-------------------



A word of caution - this isn't intended for beginning coders.

You have been warned.



This code gives your mud the ability to connect to the Intermud-3 chat

network, which is more or less the same idea as the IMC2 network some

of you may already be familiar with or members of. This originally

started off as simply a Smaug port of the code I began from, but once

I had done that I realized this would be of use to far more than just

Smaug. So once I had the Smaug code working to my satisfaction and

cleaned up to be less cluttery than what I started with, I set about

making it compile on several codebases as a standard package.

The result is what you see here. This code is a vast improvement over

the Fatal Dimensions code, as it now properly handles TCP exceptions

and socket read/write errors. It also now supports color throughout.

It has also been condensed down from the original 14 files to this

set of 3 for ease of maintenance.



This code should present no obstacles to use alongside a mud with an IMC2

network connection.



General channel guidelines:



This code comes prepackaged with 5 I3 channels. These 5 channels are

the existing set of publically accessable channels as of now that are

intended for Diku based I3 muds.



The chat channel, dchat, can be made available to your players if you

see fit, but should not be available to newbies. This chanel is not bridged.



The dimm channel should only be made available to your immortals.

It is intended for the use of immortals only. This channel is not bridged.



The dcode channel is mainly used for asking code related questions

and should probably be limited to the use of your immortals.

This channel is not bridged.



The game channel is a fun diversion that can be made available to your players

following similar guidelines to the dchat channel. This channel is host to

a gaming bot that will from time to time be set to run certain games for

people to play. This channel is currently bridged.



The bchat channel is the bridged link between the IMC2 networks and the I3

network. This channel should only be available to your immortals. It is also

subject to partial regulation of the policies of those IMC2 networks it

reaches. Such policies are known to change periodically, so keep up on them.

 

Socials can also be sent over channels, but please try to keep this

to a minimum. The social messages will be drawn from your mud's internal

social tables.

If your mud is derived from one of the above listed bases, it should

work without much trouble. Hopefully. :)



One small note - if your codebase comes with I3 preinstalled, and several do,

you can usually upgrade with the files contained in here by simply dropping

the source code files into your src directory. Usually i3.c and i3.h will be

all you need - there should rarely be a reason to change the i3cfg.h file.

If i3cfg.h needs updating, a notice will generally accompany the announcement

of an official release on the support forum.



DO NOT APPLY TO AFKMUD SOURCE! STOP NOW IF USING AFKMUD!

DO NOT APPLY TO 1STMUD SOURCE! STOP NOW IF USING 1STMUD!



I put that in bold letters since text files often refuse to allow me to use

flashing red text to get your attention - AFKMud and 1stMUD codebases both

contain customized installations of I3 which are tailored to the specifics

of each. You should obtain updates from the official releases of each codebase.

Attempting to update using the generic packges will result in compile errors.

The AFKMud Team *WILL NOT* assist in correcting this - they will instead advise

you to obtain the AFKMud version. One would assume the 1stMUD Team will insist

on the same. So do yourself a favor and don't cost yourself alot of time.



Begin Installation:

===================



1. In your main directory, create an 'i3' directory if it does not yet exist.

   In that directory, place the i3.config, i3.channels, i3.bans, i3.commands,

   i3.help, and i3.routers files. Transfer them as ASCII files.



2. Place i3.c, i3.h, and i3cfg.h files in your src directory.



3. To choose a color file, you need to know what color system ( if any ) your mud has.

   For those tags the mud's color system does not support, standard ANSI tags will be used.



   We provide the following color files:



   i3.color.ansi = Straight ANSI

      - Will use only I3 & codes and convert one way to ANSI codes.

      - Users can simply enter I3 tokens directly for color.

      - Ideal if your mud has no color system of its own or if it has no user selectable tokens.



   i3.color.samson = Samson's Color Snippet

      - For those of you who are running Samson's Custom ANSI from www.afkmud.com

      - This is the color file you'd also pick if you are running Smaug 1.4aFUSS.



   i3.color.smaug = Stock Smaug

      - For those of you using sotck Smaug and any of its derivatives listed.



   i3.color.lope = Lope's Color V2

      - Seems to be the dominant choice in Rom muds.



   i3.color.ack = Color profile for ACK muds.



   When you pick what you want, rename the file simply as i3.color so the code will be able to load it.

   Be sure your file is uploaded as ASCII.



4. Refer to the file your codebase is most closely derived from and follow the directions within.

   Any commonly known derivatives which have also been tested will have specific steps to complete in the file.



When done, return here to finish.



---------------------------------

---------------------------------



Almost there! Time to make clean and then compile and hope for the best.

Assuming all went well, you should have a nicely compiled Intermud-3 install.



Now you just need to configure it. I bet you thought this was over didn't you!



Before you reboot, make sure the i3.config file has been placed in the proper directory

and has been configured properly for your mud. The file should be fairly self explanitory.

You will not be able to connect to the I3 router until this file is ready.



Once configured, go ahead and reboot your mud. Try typing "I3" by itself on your

command line. You should get back a list of commands. Try typing "i3help" by itself

on your command line. You should see a listing of help topics available. By default,

these should also be in color. If all 3 of these conditions are met, you are ready!



Type "i3connect". Assuming you've got log channels visible, you should see some sort

of confirmation that you've connected. If not, something went wrong and you need to

check your logs for messages that indicate what.



If there are any problems with this installation, post your query to the

Intermud-3 forum located at:



http://forums.alsherok.net



If you've obtained this code from someplace OTHER than my own site

and you are encountering problems, go download it from my site before

you contact me for help. I can only support what I work on.



Adventure beckons in the lands of mystique....
