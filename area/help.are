a single weapon.  You cannot wear a shield, hold an item, or dual wield

&Cmpquest $n (questname) remove   &c(this will remove the quest from a player)
&Cmpquest $n (questname) (chapter)
&Cif quest(questname) == (chapter)

&cUsing the &Cmpquest&c command (available only to mobs, or mobprogs in room
or objects) you can set the targeted players quest journal.
For example - &Cmpquest $n (quest name) (chapter) &cto set the player to that
chapter, ONLY if they're on the previous chapter.

&Cmpquest $n Jonah 2 &c- If I was speaking to Jonah (and the quest was NAMED
Jonah), if I was on chapter 1 I would be raised to chapter 2. If I was any
other chapter, nothing would happen.

This allows mobs to start, continue AND finish quests (ie mpquest $n Jonah 1) to
start, and if Jonah only has 5 chapters and I'm on the fifth already, &Cmpquest
$n Jonah 6 &cwill finish the quest for me.

In addition, there's an ifcheck you can use to check if players are at a
certain chapter - &Cif quest(jonah) == 2 &c(if player is on chapter 2 of Jonah's
quest) etc etc, else say "Sorry, you haven't yet finished the first task!" endif.

&cTo end the quest, simply send them 1 quest higher then your max for the quest.
example: your quest chapters is 7.  &Cmpquest $n questname 8

&WRESET&c list.  This also means that typing savearea, reset area, or 
instazone will affect this area.  

To save changes permanently, type &CAASSIGN NONE&c and &CFOLDAREA&c.

WARNING!! Do not have an area aassigned to yourself when getting personal
vnums assigned to you.  The personal vnums will overwrite the area file.

In order to assign a proto area to yourself, you must either have that
area &WBESTOWED&c to you by a STAFF level 104 or higher.

that area bestowed to you by a STAFF level 105+. Even if you have the area

1 1252022747 AC~
&cAC (Armor Class) is a scale of how well protected you are against 
physical attacks. The lower (more negative) this number, the better 
protected you are from physical attacks. 

Your armor class is determined by your attributes (&WDEXTERITY&c noticeably) 
and by the equipment you wear. As you go up in levels, you must have better
equipment to keep the same armor class level.  When you identify equipment, 
you will see that all pieces of itemtype armor have their armor class shown. 
In addition to showing the item's own durability (An item of AC 10 will take 
twice as many hits to destroy than an item with AC 5), the item's AC can 
also affect your AC when you are wearing it.

107 1261674899 ADDAFFECTS~
&cSyntax: &Caddaffects <obj> <rating> <number>

&cWhere rating is a number from 1 to 15 with 10 being average powered
item, and number (OPTIONAL) is the number of affects. If you leave
<number> blank it will randomize number of affects from 1 to 5 only.

Once you have typed the command, it will set a 'rating value' on the
object's index data. This is for future reference, ie you want to see
what the object was rated at to gain these affects. Obviously you can
change the affects afterwards, and the object rating will remain the
same.

It will then DELETE ALL AFFECTS ON THE ITEM! so be careful! before
creating a pile of random affects equal to the rating value and saving
them to the item.&D

the name.

&cSyntax: &Ccast 'admonishing smite' <victim>

1 1252176072 'ADRENALINE RUSH'~
&cSyntax: &Cadrenaline

104 1252176111 ADVANCE~
&cSyntax: &Cadvance <character> <level> <class>
 &c... where class is "all", "first", "second" or "third"

&CADVANCE &csets a character's level to the specified value.  It is the
only way to create new immortal characters within the game.  &CADVANCE&c
may also be used to demote characters.

For multiclass players, use the 'class' variable to choose which of
their classes will be advanced or demoted. For non-multiclass, advance
is set to "all" by default.&D
~

101 1252176187 ADVANCEDEXITS~
&cSMAUG supports having more than one exit in the same direction, as well as
the special direction 'somewhere', represented by a '?'.

If you already have an exit leading north, and would like another one, use
a plus sign '+' in front of the direction:
  &Credit exit +n 3001          &c- Adds another exit north to room 3001

To modify an extra exit like this, or to remove it, you'll have to refer to
it by number:
  &Credit exit #2 3002          &c- Change the second exit to go to room 3002
  (to know what number an exit is, do an &CRSTAT&c)

For someone to be able to use the second north exit, you have to set one of
the extra flags (see &WEXFLAGS&c) like CAN_CLIMB.  It's also usually a good idea
to set the HIDDEN flag for any special exit so that it looks nicer to those
with autoexits on.
  
The AUTO flag makes it possible to go in a direction by simply typing the
keyword for that exit:
  &Credit exit ? 3001           &c- Create a 'somewhere' exit to 3001
  &Credit exflags ? auto hidden &c- Set the proper flags
  &Credit exname ? swim         &c- Set the keyword "swim"
  ... here, if a player types 'swim' in the room they will move to room 3001

10 1286441917 ALLIANCE~
&cALLIANCE members must be deadly and at least level 10.

This is the official posting for the Alliance Clan. For 
those who are curious, or wish to join, this should 
assist you in determining whether you should be part 
of this glorious group, or whether you might be more 
of the independent, or neutral type.
  
&wI. The Alliance History:&c

The clan was formed long ago in response to the dreaded 
armies of Tanzean'al that waged war upon the entire land. 
These dark forces sought to slay or enslave all peoples 
and races who would dare stand against their dark tyranny 
and oppression. The free races and peoples, a bulk of 
whom were elves, humans, and dwarves, put aside any 
difference, and joined into a great force to oppose the 
forces of darkness.

Even after the war was ended, and Tanzaen'al was defeated, 
the forces of both good and evil remained, as each side 
decided to stay united, after seeing what strength they 
had when banding together. The dark forces, comprised 
largely of Drow, Orcs, and Goblins, with some other 
nefarious creatures thrown in, were known as the Throng, 
while the goodly forces became known as the Alliance.

For years, fighting continued between these two groups, 
and the hatred burned bright. The Alliance would attack 
the Throng, or the Throng would attack the Alliance. There 
were times of Treaties and peace, but these would never 
last long, and war would, inevitably, break out.

The Alliance is always vigilant, and ready for the next 
attack of the dread Throng.

&wII. The Clan Purpose:&c

The purpose of the Alliance is to protect and defend the 
free cities and peoples from attacks from the Throng, as 
well as Throng influence. In fact, this clan will fight 
any threat to the innocent people of the land. All members 
of the clan will protect, and fight alongside other 
Alliance members.

The Alliance also will assist those in need, and give aid 
to any who require it, whether this is from disease, 
natural disaster, or war.  Perhaps, most important, the 
Alliance will watch for any trouble from the Throng, so 
vigilance, surveillance, and spying are functions of the 
clan. It is best to know, and be prepared for any trouble.

&wIII. Role Play in the Alliance:&c

Alliance role play can be extremely varied. Some will 
play aggressive characters who view the best way to deal 
with the Throng is in an aggressive manner, taking the 
fight to them, and smiting them where they live. Others 
will play somewhat more pacifistic types who will counsel 
for peace, and will urge non-aggression, and the avoidance 
of conflict. No matter what the views portrayed by the 
RP of the character is, they are expected to act with honor, 
and with absolute loyalty to the clan, and to the decisions 
made by leadership. All voices and opinions will be heard. 
Role play is highly encouraged within the clan.

&wThe Code of Honor and Conduct: &cAll Alliance members are to
respect their clan-mates, and to never raise a weapon 
against another Alliance member. They are expected to help 
in whatever way they can in times of war, and when the 
clan is raided. This could be anything from potion making 
to healing to actual fighting. No Alliance member shall 
ever betray the confidence of private clan matters or 
strategies to outsiders, or, needless to say, to the 
Throng. No Alliance member should disrespect the Chieftain 
or War Master, or go counter to their orders, though 
speaking up if they disagree is fine, as long as it is 
done in a tone of respect. Treat your clan-mate as you 
would be treated, and all will be well.

&wThe Chieftain:&c He is leader of the clan, and he sets the
general tone of dealing with the Throng and all outsiders. 
An aggressive Chieftain who believes in taking the fight 
to the enemy will be influence the clan that way, while 
a pacifist leader who avoids conflict will influence the 
clan that direction. The Chieftain's word is final on most 
matters, save for matters of war where he or she will 
default to the authority of the War Master. The Chieftain 
will rule upon all in-clan disputes, and will maintain 
order, and enforce honor. The Chieftain can be either 
aggressive or pacifist, but should RP accordingly.

&wThe War Master: &cHis/Hers is the area of strategy, and all
military matters. He/She decides on the handling of war 
and operations against all enemies, and is in charge of 
recon and spying operations. The War Master will also 
assist the Chieftain in making many decisions. 

If you think you are cut out for this clan, contact a 
member to be referred to the Chieftain or War Master, 
or talk to them directly. It should be great fun!

-1 1252018903 ANGEL~
&cAngels, the celestial beings, were created by the Creator to watch over his
domain for all eternity. However, since the rise of evil on the mortal
plane, they have taken on a more unreserved role in the defense of the mortal
plane. They were the ones who defeated Tanzean'al's horde the first time it
appeared. After Tanzean'al was defeated the first time they stayed behind and
intermingled with its inhabitants. Now however that the threat is back, many
mortals have manifested their hidden potential granted to them by their ancestors
and have once again taken up the fight against Tanzean'al on The Creator's behalf.

An angel is very intelligent and utilizes many gifts provided by The Creator
including the ability to heal people within a certain range and to call flames
directly from The Creator to smite its foes. It also has the ability to reinforce
a person's natural abilities and call forth their hidden potential.

Angels are physically average, and average in magic.

An Angel focuses primarily on &WSTRENGTH&c.

Angels come from the following races - &WCELESTIAL

            STR   INT   WIS   DEX   CON   CHA   LCK

bottom of the list, where older would appear on top of the list. 

The &CAREAS INFO &ccommand displays information about a particular area,
including anyone who has derived upon that work.

You can specify a level range to see a list of all areas with suggested
ranges which encompass the argument.  This can be a little awkward as
each area has a low and a high suggested range.  Suffice to say that if
an area's level range matches even one level of the range you request,
it will be displayed.

Sometimes areas might have enforced levels. Meaning the recommended level range
is the range of levels when you can enter the place, when it's not restricted
or enforced, you can visit this place at another level as well.

101 1268538824 ARMORCLASS~
&cThere are two values used with armor class for object type Armor:

Value0: Variable amount based on level of item at repop.
Value1: Maximum repairable armor setting for the object.

Setting Value0 has no effect. It will re-adjust itself on repop based on
the repop level of the item. Setting Value1 below the expected repop value
for Value0 will result in an item that cannot be repaired until Value0 drops
below Value1's setting. The listing below gives you a rough approximation of 
the values returned for Value0 based on level:

Level Invoked   Value0   Level Invoked   Value0   Level Invoked   Value0 
&W-------------   ------   -------------   ------   -------------   ------

The amount that Value0 is set to determines the amount the player's A.C. will
be adjusted.

This skill draws on the kinetic energy to form around the fleshy body 
creating an astral form.  The astral form is invisible, and can walk
through crevices and cracks, where the body couldn't.

The skill uses a lot of kinetic power to maintain it.  To return back

.  With training in both combat and spellcasting, the augurer is a 
versatile and balanced class, able to handle a greater variety of 
situations than a dedicated mage or warrior. 

   The augurer is a more subtle breed of spellcaster. Without as 
impressive a repertoire of attack spells as a mage the augurer 
mostly relies on spells to give his combat skills an edge, rather 
than flashy displays of arcane might. He is well versed in the 
traditional methods of combat with blades and blunt instruments, as 
well as the various mystic shields and curses at his disposal. The 
augurer is adept at strengthening his own hand at the expense of 
his opponent's.

-1 1252019392 BARD TROUBADOUR DIRGE~
&cAkin to clerics/priests with their healing abilities, bards are unique
in the fact that instead of casting spells they harness the power of music
to inspire their followers and demoralize their enemies. Using normal
instruments they are able to coax forth a tune that will have even 
Tanzean'al himself dancing for joy.

Instead of the &CCAST&c command, Bards use &CPLAY&c. They will need the right
type of instrument to play the song. The song will stay in effect until
the music stops playing - either the bard must rest, or he fails to
find the right note (or some other concentration failure).

Because of this, the bard is a welcome ally to any group - his songs
can't run out in the middle of a tough battle, and he has some unique
numbers that greatly enhance his members fighting abilities. He also
has some decent solo abilities, but was designed generally with a
captivated audience in mind.
   
Bards are physically average, yet weak in magic.

A Bard focuses primarily on &WDEXTERITY&c, and to a lesser extent,
on &WCONSTITUTION&c.

Bards come from the following races - &WHUMAN, ELF, HALFLING, PIXIE, GNOME&c.

            STR   INT   WIS   DEX   CON   CHA   LCK

perform other extraneous combat actions (i.e. you will be able to 
dodge/parry/attack but nothing else). These same consequences are 
inflicted upon your opponent should he be another player. Should you be

&cSyntax: &Cbite 

&cGenerally speaking, &CBITE&c is a simple attack skill that will attempt
to damage your opponent through the use of your teeth. Many mobs are
able to bite you during battle (creatures rather than humanoids).

Vampires:
Vampires can bite their victim, only after grabbing them and rendering 
them powerless. Many tried to bite them out of nowhere and found it is not 
a good method, therefore now vampires are taught not to use this skill to 
commence a fight, but rather to bite when the victim has succumbed to the 
vampire's will.

to the teeth.'

-1 1279740800 CELESTIAL~
&cCelestial's are an ancient, angelic race transcended from mortals and
charged by the heavens to protect humankind. They are composed of pure 
energy, but often take the material form of a human while they walk on 
the earth. Having existed on an immaterial plane for a time, they 
sometimes find the transition into mortal life a little confusing.

Once on earth and outside of the Creator's influence, they find themselves
with Divine powers beyond that of a normal human, and the willpower to pick
and choose their targets as they see fit. Most decide to stay as 'guardian
angels', but there are those that turn their powers to darker, personal gain.

Base stats for celestial before are the below, what class you chose will also
adjust your stats.

            STR  INT    WIS    CON    CHA     DEX   LCK

&cThe charm spell, if successful, will place the victim (only mobs, attempts;to charm other player-characters may incur the wrath of the gods) under
your control for the duration of the spell.  While under your control
the creature is your servant, and may assist you in combat and other
more minor duties.  Use the 'order' command to give them orders.
Be warned, you are responsible for the actions of your charmed beast.  If
it should go awry and take the life of another player-character, you will
be charged as a murderer and will be hunted by several creatures around
the realms of Six Dragons.
Aggressive mobs will lose their aggressiveness while charmed, but will
immediately return to their violent ways when the spell wears off. For
this reason, charmed aggressive mobs should not be taken into any area
lower from the one from which they came, and should *never* be taken
into Paleon or other homelands.  Those found doing so will pay dearly.
Deadlies may bring mobs into other homeland than Paleon but will remain
TOTALLY responsible for protecting peaceful players from said mobs.
As a matter of etiquette, charmed mobs should not be attacked.  You can
tell a mob is charmed if it is wandering "in a dazed, zombie-like state."
Be aware when taking your charmed mobs around other characters that any
area attack such as call lightning, gas breath or earthquake will hit
your creature and cause it to engage in combat.

101 1202554070 CLIMATE~
With the new implementation of Weather. Comes a new meaning for Climates.
Climates are no longer what each area has, but now are a flag applied to
the weather cells across the weather "map". The following are available:
 
rainforest, savanna, desert, steppe, chapparal, grasslands, deciduous_forest, 
taiga, tundra, alpine, and arctic.
 
Now, a brief explanation will follow for each, but these flags cause the
system to force changes into cells with each update, to keep weather consistant
with what is supposed to be within that cell.
 
Rain Forest - This climate will produce a lot of rain and high heats, not quite
as hot as a desert, but hot none the less. An earth example would be the Amazon
region in South America.
 
Savanna - This is a climate that produces a two season year, one being wet, the
other being dry. And the temperature varies between but maintaining equatorial
area temperatures for earth. An example would be the Serengeti of Africa. 
Desert - Hot, Dry, Arid. This climate is home to cacti, camels, and other such
Desert creatures and plants. A prime example is the Sahara Desert.
 
Steppe - Characterized by grasslands, this is a semiarid climate. It can be
found normally between the desert climate and more humid climates. An example
of this climate would be the Mongolian Steppes in Eurasia.
 
Chapparal - This is another semiarid climate, with long dry summers and shorter
wet winters. The primary example of this is the Mediterranean Coast, or a bit
of Southern California.
 
See: CLIMATE2
See Also: SETWEATHER SHOWWEATHER WEATHER
~

101 1202554075 CLIMATE2~
Grasslands - These are large climates of grassy plains and varying weather. The
rainfall in these climates is enough to support the growth of grass, but not
much else. An example would be the Great Plains of the Central United States.

Deciduous Forest - This is a "perfect" climate. This is one of the few climates
that really experiences all four seasons, with changes in each. It is normally
characterized by the lush forests that grow within it, and the varied plant
and wildlife that live within. The Eastern United States all falls under this
climate.

Taiga - The Taiga is also know as the Boreal Forest Climate, because it is
mostly only needleleafed trees that grow within this ravaging climate. The
wind in this type of climate is very unforgiving, and trees are known to 
only grow in clumps because of this. The best example of this climate
would be the interior of Alaska, or North-Central Canada.

Tundra - The tundra climate is found along arctic coastal areas. The winter
season is long and severe, and a short, mild summer exists but it barely
noticeable. The best example of the tundra would be Coastal Alaska, or
Iceland.

Alpine - These are the mountain climates found mostly (on Earth) in Eurasia.
The Himalayan Mountains are the best example. These climates produce colder
temperatures than the climates around them, merely because of altitude
difference.
 
Arctic - Cold. Always Frozen. Almost the exact opposite of a desert. Could
technically be considered a desert by the definition of the word. These
climates produce below freezing temperatures almost year round. Antarctica
would be the best example of an Arctic climate.

&Y6D Code of Conduct&c 

This helpfile will not cover all situations, but is intended to give Staff
a clearer idea for Staff and players interaction 

&WScenario # 1&C
I don't like the way my fellow Staff member is doing something, yet we are 
equals, or in opposing councils. Politely discuss the matter with the 
Staff member, do not argue, if they don't agree with you. Take the matter 
to their council head, if they are a council head take it to the Game 
Admin. Once you tell that council head, or Game Admin don't worry about 
it, you have done your part. While you may disagree with how a fellow 
STAFF member is handling something, back them publicly towards the 
players. This shows a united front, and keeps any disagreements on how 
things are handled from the players. 

&WScenario # 2&C
I am Staff, and a player is talking about something I don't agree with, 
but it is not offensive. If you wish to express your opinion on it, do so, 
but don't go on, and on arguing with players about this and that. We don't 
want to put ourselves in positions where we appear to have something against 
a particular player or group of players. Just a ooc Can't say I agree with 
that. Is fine, and let the matter drop don't get drawn into arguments. 

&WScenario # 3&C
As Staff we must separate our alts from our Staff alt.  We don't let players 
know we have a Staff alt, and we don't give them that impression.  Don't get 
too wrapped up in your alts, that you let something that happens to them affect 
how you deal with any other players.  Let's face we are Staff we have advantages 
of game knowledge that other players don't.  We can take lumps now and then, and 
still thrive.

- Not saying other players shouldn't have to follow rules in dealing with our 
alts, but we need to do the punishment and move on.  No snide comments on public 
channels, tells, etc.   We are supposed to be professionals and above that type 
of behavior. 

- Also, even though we may think players don.t know our alts, 9/10 chances are 
they do know, and will know that it is you that is dealing with them in a 
non-professional manner and will tell other players/staff.

101 1238698236 COC2~
&WScenario # 4&C

A player is continuously whining, crying on public channels and ruining the fun 
for everyone in the game.  Send them a tell informing them that whining is not 
permitted on public channels, because it affects everyone.s game enjoyment.  If 
they continue after your tell, silence them trans them to your office and tell 
them they can post on the forums, or send the Game Admin an email about their 
issue, but they cannot continue whining on public channels.  If they agree to 
that in the office, remove the silence, if not keep them silent and comment 
their pfile.  Send me an email so I know what happened.  90% of disciplinary 
issues on 6 Dragons stems from this getting out of hand.  Yah I made that figure 
up, but it just seems to be that way.

&WScenario # 5&C
Players that break rules.  Players are extremely important to our game, and 
should not be dealt with excessively harsh.  Let.s face it, players are not easy 
to come by for muds now adays.  When a player breaks a rule, depending on the 
severity of it, just a verbal counseling is all that is necessary the first time.  
Put a comment on the player that you counseled them about the situation.  So if 
they do it again, then any other Staff will know harsher methods maybe needed 
whether it be a slay, or whatever.

Anything harsher than slay/purging of corpse, defer to Game Admin.  Give reasons 
you believe something harsher should happen.

&WScenario # 6&C
Staff are not immortals, or deities, we are here to assist players with game 
enjoyment.  That is what you should tell players on all regular channels however, 
if you wish to roleplay on icc channel I consider that channel fantasy.  As 
long as you are not doing mudsex, or getting disgustingly gross to other players.

&WScenario # 7&C
I have designated the mud PG-13 for rating, but with that said, we want to attract 
and keep players.  There is a swear channel, but disgusting talk about doing things 
to babies and whatnot that is offensive to others should not be allowed.  Send the 
player a tell that kind of talk is not permitted, then if they continue silence 
them and talk to them in the office.  If they agree to no longer talk about it, 
remove the silence but put a comment on them about the behavior.

.
&cCREATE( pointer, data_type, amount)&C - allocates memory for data_type and
assigns pointer the address of the memory it creates

&cLINK (node, first_node, last_node, next, prev)&C will insert node in the
doubly linked list, at the end of it.

&cUNLINK(node, first_node, last_node, next, prev)&C will remove node from
the doubly linked list its in.

&cINSERT(node, node_before, first_node, next, prev)&C will insert node, before
node_before in a doubly linked list.

&cDISPOSE(pointer)&C frees pointer that was created with CREATE

&cQUICKLINK: &Cincrements the internal usage counter for a hashed string and
returns a pointer to said string

&cSTRALLOC: &Cduplicates a string.  searches the string hash table for the
string, and if it exists, performs the equivalent of a QUICKLINK.  if it
doesnt exist, it adds it to the hash table and returns a pointer to the
new (hashed) copy of the string.  can use this on either hashed or
unhashed strings, but it returns a hashed string.

.
&cSTRFREE:&C frees a hashed string.

&cQUICKMATCH:&C compares two hashed strings ("quickly") by comparing their
memory addresses.  it wont crash you if you use it on an unhashed string, 
but it will always return false.  (hashed strings share memory which is 
why this works for them, and the whole purpose of hashing in the first 
place really)

&cfread_string: &Creads a tilde-terminated string from a file, hashes it,
and returns a pointer to the string

&cstr_dup: &Cduplicates a string.  can be used on either hashed or unhashed,
but returns an unhashed string.

&cfread_string_nohash: &Cdoes the same as fread_string, but the string 
doesnt get hashed.

Typical use is as follows :

Allocation  | Deallocation | Reading From File

Before asking an immortal for a corpse retrieval, you &r-must-:&w
 
&r    -&w Attempt to get your corpse yourself, &rand
    -&w Use invis and hidden, this will get you past a lot of mobiles,&r and
    -&w Seek mortal assistance to retrieve your corpse.&r
    -&g If all else fails, wait at least 20 minutes after death to ask for an
      Staff member corpse retrieval.&w

**  "I need to leave now!" is not grounds for an early Staff member CR.
**  Corpses last approximately 40 - 60 minutes after the time of death.
**  Corpse decay will happen even while you are linkdead or after you quit.
**  Characters listed under 'who deadly' are not eligible for Staff member CR.
**  Corpses _will_ save over crashes and reboots, but will continue to decay
    once the Realms comes back online.  Log back on quickly to get corpse.

The cost for CRs is usually one item from your corpse.  A Staff member may
choose to charge MORE or LESS. 
 
&gA Staff member corpse retrieval is not a right, but a privilege.&w  Pestering
or being demanding is cause for the Staff member to deny your request.  An
Staff member may refuse to do any CR at their discretion.  You may not barter
which items a Staff member can take from your corpse as the charge, the
Staff member's decision is final.

1 1122239142 CREATOR THECREATOR~
.
At the beginning of time, the CREATOR established the realms and all life.
He passed down the secrets of magic to the mortals in order to make life
easier, but one of these mortals was not satisfied with merely the creators
gifts. He wanted to take his place and sought out to do so buy summoning
an army to take over all the realms newly created. This mortal was named
Tanzean'al, and he would soon aquire the immortality he sought after. The
creator, infuriated with this magicians abuse of these magical offerings
granted him immortality but summened the dark one deeps into the pits of hell
to burn for all eternity.
 
From his fiery new home, Tanzean'al continued to summon forth dark minions
to do his biddings. In order to prevent a second happening of this horribly
accident, the Creator scattered his magical bestowments throughout the lands
ensuring that only those who are patient and worthy would ever come to aquire
enough magics to contend with the will of the creator.
 
To combat the evil will of Tanzean'al the Creator issued forth a call to arms
for all those willing to take up weapons in this epic battle between good
and evil.

CRUSADER

&cThe crusader is a tank that follows a religious path in life.
Due to the crusader's strong conviction, they can call upon their faith
to perform some clergy-type feats of power.

Crusaders are warrior priests who draw their power from acts of righteousness
and strict adherence to the Code of The Temple of Solomon.  Their strength
in battle, combined with the ability to perform limited miracles is offset
by the difficulty they experience in perfecting their craft, and the penalties
they suffer when they stray from the path of good.

Crusaders are physically strong, yet weak in magic.

A Crusader focuses primarily on &WSTRENGTH&c, and to a lesser extent
on &WWISDOM&c.

Crusaders come from the following races - &WHUMAN ELF DWARF HALFLING 
PIXIE GNOME

Any spells which were affecting you are canceled by death, and you lose

A "death trap" refers to the scenario where one steps into a room and is
immediately awakened from death with no equipment or corpse. A corpse
recovery is not an option in this case as there is no corpse to retrieve.
 
There are also pseudo death traps that may appear to be a dt, but leave a 
corpse or transfer a corpse to another area. This is not a true dt. 
 
It is often advisable to look before one leaps and heed room descriptions.
DT's do not warrant a reimbursement, they are a part of the game. Gold, 
glory and favor are not affected by a death trap.

skills. Demons are cunning and evil.

Despite their dark natures, demons have a seductive allure. They are also
intelligent, agile, and possessed of high stamina.

Base stats for demon before are the below, what class you chose will also
adjust your stats.
            STR  INT    WIS    CON    CHA     DEX   LCK
Demon       &W20   14     14     16     10      12    14

Syntax: deny       <character>
Syntax: disconnect <character>
Syntax: freeze     <character>

DENY denies access to a particular player and throws them out of the game.
DENY persists past reboots and crashes and can only be undone by either loading
up the character and doing a 'mset <character name> flags deny', or by editing
the player file offline.

DISCONNECT <character> immediately disconnects that character.

FREEZE <character> is a toggle which prevents a character from issuing any
commands at all.

The &wDESCRIPTION&c command puts you into an editor to edit your character 
description (what people see when they look at you). 

The &wBIO&c command puts you into an editor to edit your personal bio: 
what people see when they &wWHOIS&c you. A bio (short for biography) is 
about your character : your history, who are you? A bio should be written 
in the same roleplay theme as your description. 

For more information on how to use these editors, read the appropriate 
helpfile (&Weditor)&c 

&RAttention : A Staff member can request you to change your description or 
bio should it contain inappropriate material. Do not use profanity, racial 
slurs, sexual comments, other players' names (without their permission), 
or off-color remarks. Refusal to change your bio, description, or title on 
STAFF request is grounds for loss of character privileges. 

&wHint : Try to make your bio readable. For eg. by using chapters (add a 
blank line in between blocks of text). Try not to make your bio so long 
that we have to scroll back to read it fully.

1 1255706441 DEX DEXTERITY~
&cDexterity (DEX in your &CSCORE&c) represents your character's agility, and
it affects (among other things):

 - the maximum number of items you can carry at once in your inventory;
   with each additional point of dex you can carry additional items.

 - each additional point of dexterity also lowers (improves) your natural
   armor class.

 - the number of new moves you receive each time you level, as well as the
   number of moves you regenerate at each tick (when resting to refresh or
   regain movement points).

 - success chances with bash, stun and gouge, and helps determine whether a
   thief will be able to poison a weapon or use dodge skills effectively.

Dexterity is also very important for quaffing potions in combat.  High dex
will allow you to quaff without dropping many potions during the heat of
battle, while a poor dexterity will cause you to accidentally drop many
of the valuable vials.
  
Dexterity is the prime attribute of thieves and assassins. It is also a
requirement of vampires (think stealth and agility).

&cSyntax:  &Cdig
&cSyntax:  &Cdig  <direction>
&cSyntax:  &Cbury <item>

&cYou can dig and bury items through the use of the dig skill and bury command.
Buried items are not visible to players, even through the use of spells such
as locate object.  To dig an item up, type dig with no arguments.  Having a
shovel raises your chance of success.  If you dig in a direction, you will
attempt to 'dig open' a collapsed exit (ie no door). You can't dig under doors.

To bury an item (or corpse), drop the item on the ground and &Cbury <item>&c.
Depending on the size and weight of the object, you might need a shovel.

&W* Note:  Deadly players can bury/dig up each other's corpses. *

&cItems buried will not last beyond crash or reboot.  Do not attempt to use
this skill for storage of items you wish to keep.&D

101 1216211290 DISAPPEARBUG~
I've looked up a pile of functions, rewriten a pile of code also.
Suffice to say the actual bug is elusive! It does NOT show up in
ch->next_in_room loops, so the bug is basically the invisible mob
is not getting linked into the room mobs properly. Why this is so,
I have no idea. But will keep trying to find out.

A bit more on the bug. Happens during copyover. To do with linking
players/mobs in a room together. Look into that code. ie before
copyover, players/mobs in room are linked one after the other. After
copyover, one player/mob has come out of the link.

So I would say at this stage i'm looking for somewhere in copyover
code where players aren't properly linked/unlinked. When I find it
i'll just put in char_to_room or char_from_room (which autolinks)
and should be sweet to go.

Not sure whether this will always work, but force the mob to leave the 
room, purge him, then reset area worked to make that particular mob 
visible again in my case.

~

1 1256225122 'DISPEL MAGIC'~
&cSyntax:  &Ccast 'dispel magic' <character>

&cThis spell will dispel a magical affect on the victim.  It may be used 
as an offensive spell to remove an enemy's magical advantages, or as a 
benign spell to completely remove your own magical affects.

If you are not a mage, you must be affected by the 'detect magic' to be
able to use this spell.  Though mages do not necessarily need to use it,
being under the affects of 'detect magic' will reveal more information
unavailable otherwise or to other classes.

Dispel magic can be used by players and mobiles alike against either
players or mobiles.  It cannot remove affects from equipment, your race
or your deity; some other affects are immune to this spell as well.

When a caster successfully casts dispel magic on themselves they will
remove all of their dispel-able magical affects.  If a mage successfully
dispels a victim, the number of affects stripped will depend on their
success and intelligence.  Otherwise a successful cast of 'dispel magic'
on a victim will result in the removal of a single affect each time
(victims will notice when and what affects are stripped).

WARNING:  this is an offensive spell, and its use on anyone other than
yourself will be treated as an attack on your target.&D

The race of dragons live somewhat secluded from other races.
Dragons can live to be thousands of years old.

Dragons are larger then other races even at a very young age.
Only on rare occasions do dragons have anything to do with other
races.  However, these are dark times and each individual dragon
type may have their own reason for dealing with other races.
 
* Note: Power levelers - Dragons are very hard to level, they
should be more thought of as an investment, and are great for
roleplaying. 

Dragons cannot wield weapons, but because of their size they
get a bonus to hitroll and damroll that increases as they grow. 
Dragons grow in height and weight with each level.

Dragons get massive in size and weight, and there are many objects 
that they just can't wear because they are too darn big.

2. Dragons don't use mortal weapons of any kind, why would they?
3. Dragons are limited on some of the equipment they can wear.
4. Dragons cannot be in clans.  They don't get along with each

-1 1237202907 DROW DROWELVES~
DROW

&cDrow are the darker, more evil cousins of Elves.  They were once part of
the happy community of Elves which roam the forests today, but have long
since moved under the ground, building vast subterranean cities and
complex networks of caves.

Drow have black skin and white hair, and are moderately weaker and have
a more slight constitution than average humans.  Still, like all Elves,
they have a slightly higher dexterity than men.

Members of this race specialize in spell casting, and have thus developed
a very high intelligence.  Being creatures of darkness the Drow tend to
fight more proficiently in the darkness, and have innate infravision with
which to discern objects and living things in the absence of light.

Base stats for drow before are the below, what class you chose will also
adjust your stats.

attitudes tend to be less  than likable. This race has produced some of the 
most renowned fighters.

complexions and thick, fur-covered torsos and limbs.  Both men and women

         eat   <object> <container>      (eat directly from a container)
 
Drink instructs your character to drink from a fountain or a drink container
to alleviate thirst.
 
Eat instructs your character to eat an item of food or a magical pill (which
function in a similar fashion as potions); pills do not fill stomach space.
 
When you are hungry or thirsty (you will see messages at each tick that
tell you if you are starving or dying of thirst, and can check your
current state with either 'score' or 'oldscore'), you will not regain
hitpoints, movement points or mana back as rapidly as if you were well
fed and hydrated.
 
If you stay hungry or thirsty too long and you are not an Avatar, your
mental state will begin to suffer.  Your combat skills will be affected,
your coordination will suffer and you may begin to either hallucinate or
become depressed.  Eating, drinking and a little rest will solve this
problem after a short period of time.

101 1122239142 ECONOMY~
Each area will initialize (on bootup of the mud) with a pool of gold based
on the area's range and the wealth of each mob in that area.
 
The shopkeepers and thieves will automatically deposit gold into the economy
if they are carrying more than a certain amount (the higher the level of the
shopkeeper, the greater they will carry before depositing).
 
To allow mobprogs to be created to manipulate area economies, making them
interactive and interdependent, there are two mpcommands:  mpdeposit, and
mpwithdraw (see related helpfiles).  There is also an 'if economy' ifcheck.
 
The aset command can also be used to adjust an area's economy by hand
(example:  aset <area filename> low_economy <amount>, this will give
the specified area a minimum economy at the level you set).
 
Mobs will not repop with more gold than what they were originally created
with, but if the area economy runs low they will begin to repop with less
until the economy is replenished (as they all share the same gold pool).
 
Use foldarea to make changes to an area's economy with aset permenent.

If you wish to preserve the equipment, you must repair it by taking it to
the town blacksmith. (NOTE:  Not all equipment is repairable)  You may also
notice that while fighting a creature which attacks you with acid breath or
another acid attack, your equipment gets "etched and pitted."  When this
occurs the AC on that item is damaged by one permanently.  You cannot
repair the damage done by "pitting and etching."

101 1157094329 EXITMAKING~
The 'redit exit' command is used to create, modify and remove exits in a room.
Currently there can only be one exit in a certain direction.
The syntax of the 'redit exit' command is as follows:
redit exit <direction> [vnum] [exit-type] [key] [keyword(s)]
direction: one of: n, s, e, w, u, d, ne, nw, se, sw or ?
vnum     : the room number in which the exit leads to.
exit-type: a number detailing the exit -- has a door, open/closed/locked etc.
key      : a number corresponding to a key object which can unlock the door.
keywords : keywords used to refer to the door, (or exit).

If only 'redit exit <direction>' is specified, the exit will be removed.
The 'key' field is optional when specifying keywords.  All other fields are
required previous to the field desired.

Examples:
redit exit n 3001           - Creates an exit north to room 3001
redit exit n 3001 3 gate    - Changes the exit north to have a closed "gate"
redit exit n 3001 3 15 gate - Changes the gate to allow use of a key vnum 15
redit exit n                - Removes the north exit

1 1157901270 EXPERIENCE EXP~
&RThis helpfile was designed, and has been amended several times, by Volk to
explain how experiences here works. Please refrain from yelling out 'help!
i've got an xp bug!!1one lolz' because it's rather annoying when i'm knee-
deep in 15 other, more immensely important, projects for the mud.
&W
You can gain experience to level your character through just about everything - from
adepting skills and spells, to completing quests, to simply hacking and slashing through
mobs. Priests gain experience from healing. Mages from casting. Fighters gain more
experience in battle than other classes, but also lose more for fleeing/dying.
Scouts gain a small amount of experience for exploring new areas.

This helpfile will explain to you how you gain experience from mobs, and why there's no
such thing as an 'experience bug'. Firstly, if the mob you're fighting is within 10 levels
of your own level, you'll gain experience for every hit you land on the mob. The stronger
the mob and the more amount of damage you do to it, the more experience you'll gain (note -
fighters get a bit extra).&z
xp_gain = (( ch->fighting->xp * dam ) / (victim->max_hit)) * (victim->level / ch->level)
&W
Secondly, once you've actually KILLED the mob, you'll gain another payload of experience. This
takes into account several factors, those being:

Your level versus the level of the mobile. To gain any experience at all, you must be within
20 levels. If the mob is higher level than you, you'll gain more experience. Lower level, you'll
gain less. This has been SERIOUSLY revamped to ensure that there's a decent range to match our
100 level system.

The mobile's 'worth' of experience. This is calculated by the mob's level, it's maximum hp, armor
class, hitroll and damroll (plus any dice involved) and randomised.

How many times you've killed the mob. See 'HELP KHISTORY'.

And finally, any extra flags the mob has to make it stronger/weaker, such as: being aggressive
(attacks on sight), having shockshield/fireshield, any resistances or immunities the mob has etc.
&zxp_gain = (get_exp_worth(victim) * URANGE(0,(victim->level - gchlev)+21, 10))/10

&GIn addition to all of this, it actually MAKES SENSE to have large groups here. If you would
normally get 100k from killing a mob solo, with 2 players you would both get about 75k each. With
3 players (killing the mob 3 times quicker), you would all gain about 62k each. MORE EXPERIENCE
WITH MORE MEMBERS!

&RIf you are still having problems, experience is now a gameplay issue. It is not related to
anything that can be 'fixed' in the code. If you are not having luck levelling in one area,
it is recommended that you simply try another area. Please keep your anger in check, and know
that we are churning out areas as fast as we can - these things take time, but we are working
hard to make this a better place for all of us.

The Great Wizard Thanatos, after creating his fabled WarMagicks,
found himself snubbed and abused in and about The Realms for his
researches.  Much time would pass before mages and other classes
alike would learn the true power of these spells.
 
In the interim, disguised as an assassin, Thanatos became interested
in a more minor problem: that of carrying off the loot he gained
from all those he slew with Quantum Spike.  Realising that such a
formula would be easily grasped by his class, he thought to extend
it freely.
 
As a final touch to the spell, he thought he would spite those of
other classes by inbuing into these containers a quality which made
them unobtainable by the other classes.

&cFreeze tag is a popular game, it can take place with up to 2 friends or
a thousand.  The teams are divided into 2 groups, &RRED&c and &CBLUE&c.  They are
then transported to the frozen &WARCTIC ARENA&c.  Once there, the object is 
to freeze the entire other team, by tagging them.  

You may start a freeze tag game with 2 or more players by typing &WFTAG START&c.

This game is accomplished by typing &CTAG <player name>&c.  Once frozen, they cannot 
move or tag others.  However, if another member of their team tags them, they are 
unfrozen and can move again.  Use of triggers is prohibited.

&CRED&c/&CBLUE&c are channels used while playing freeze tag to communicate with your 
fellow team mates.  You may use the channels to direct your team, or ask for
help from your team.

Example:
&CBLUE&W Telara: Are you cheating?&c
&RRed &WVladaar: No I'm not using my goto command to tag you, you're just slow.

101 1122239142 FURNITURE 'FURNITURE VALUES'~
It is now possible to sit/sleep/rest/stand on furniture.
 
Here is how all of this works.
 
value0 - Max Number of people on obj (default 1)
value1 - Max weight an object can take before breaking (default 750)
value2 - sit/sleep/rest/stand on furniture (more below)
value3 - Percent of health/move is gained by furniture (100 is times 1)
value4 - Percent of mana is gained by furniture (100 is times 1)
         **Default is if the value is 0 and default for v3 and v4 is 100**
As for value2, it uses bitvictors, and here are their numbers
 
SIT ON -    1        SIT IN -    2        SIT AT -    4
STAND ON -  8        STAND IN -  16       STAND AT -  32
SLEEP ON -  64       SLEEP IN -  128      SLEEP AT -  256
REST ON -   512      REST IN -   1024     REST AT -   2048
 
Furniture is set using the v2 setting and through adding the
values to make it work.  Say you want SIT ON and STAND IN, you
would add 1 and 16 and get 17.
 
A quick note, you can only be on in at an object.  If you
set all 3 of them to lets say Sit, when type type sit
object, they will sit at the object.  So only select one.

break: This command will set a breakpoint on the specified line, and 
optionally the specified file. (ie: break comm.c:150) A breakpoint is 
a spot where the program will stop executing so that you can 
examine the variables at that point.

print: This command will allow you to examine variables. It accepts 
typecasts just like in your C code, as well as pointer defererencing. 
You can type "print ch->name" to see the name of a character 
in a function, "print *ch" to dump the entire char_data structure 
pointed to by "ch", etc. This is one the most important and most 
powerful commands.

The Gith are a race descended from humans.  Once long ago, they were a
peaceful civilization of humans that were captured by mind flayers and
tormented for centuries.  Eventually, a savior named Gith led them to
freedom, yet their bodies had been flayed by the mental powers of the
illithids.  The Gith found themselves, stronger, quicker, luckier and
smarter than average humans, yet they had lost much of their faith,
wisdom, stamina and charisma.
 
They had yellowed skin and were very long of limb.  Sunken eyes peered
from yellowed sockets, now strangely capable of naturally detecting
invisible things.  The Gith race has split into three distinct groups
recently.  The good, the Githzerai, the selfish neutral, the Pirates
of Gith, and the evil, the Githyanki.

reach &WAVATAR &Clevel, ie. level 100.  Then they may wear two glory objects at

of the following: hp, mana, str, int, wis, con, dex, cha.  These stats will
be listed with the &WGLORY COSTS &Ccommand.  The &WGLORY COSTS &Ccommand will also

You can use qpset to give glory to players.
  
I just want to be clear though, that we shouldn't be giving glory away like
candy, it is something that must be earned.  Trivia sessions where players 
google all the answers shouldn't give much at all in glory.  Maybe 5 for the
winner of the entire session, and 1 for participants.

Other events like quests, and contests of sorts, sure 10 to 15 points for the 
winner is fine.  Glory is something players should be proud of.  Not everyone
can get.  You will notice players can really make themselves better then average
player from doing it too, so please don't give it out recklessly.

Qpset command is logged, not by any means trying to scare anyone away from 
using it, just be responsible about it.

For example if your object could hold 200 glory, and you had 200 glory to use.
Mana costs 2 glory per mana adjustment to an object.  You could make that object
affected by 100 mana.

Typing &WGLORY STAT <&Cobject name&W>&c will tell you how much glory an object can hold.

Flags:&C metal, bless, glow, hum, loyal&c
Flags on an object make them less susceptible to being damaged, the more the flag
costs the better protection the object has.

The &CLOYAL&c flag also protects the wielder from being disarmed by other players.
Although the protection from being damaged is the lowest protection.&c

Note: Items affected by glory will receive ownership of the person who added the glory.
This means, you cannot trade items between characters.

GNOMES

&cGnomes are a quirky demi-human race.  Though not the mightiest of
races, they are well versed in their studies of knowledge, magic
and religions.  Additionally, due to their familiarity with such
lore, they tend to be more resistant to magic energies.  They can, 
though, suffer tremendously from fire.

Gnomes usually focus in the magical or clerical arts, though a few
gnomes have ventured into the arts of physical combat (albeit often 
not very well.). Gnomes are physically weak although mentally
strong.

Gnomes are a short, stocky race, similar to their dwarven cousins.
Most often prefer an evening at home with a magical tome, pipeweed,
a loaf of bread, and a cup of ale over venturing out to battle.

1 1237061936 HALCYON~
I. The Clan History: 

The Neutral Clan was formed during those dark times 
of no magic, where all had to learn to get along and help one another. 
Since they were always scorned for their perpetual believe in 
non-violence, they were forced into secrecy, so that none could harm them 
while they worked to help those they could. It was not an easy task that 
they undertook, for the helped all: Good and Evil. They let no one go 
without the proper care, even those they helped sometimes slayed the ones 
to whom they should owe their lives. It was a sad, pitiful existence, but 
those of the Neutral Clan didn't give it a second thought. To do so would 
mean their struggle of helping all those who come before them would be a 
lie. 

II. The Clan Purpose: 

This clan would see the squabbles and wars between the Alliance and the 
Throng as wasteful, in terms of time and life, as well as destructive to 
the land. They would urge a compromise, and a balance in power between both 
those clans, and races that tend to be natural enemies. 

III. Role Play in the Neutral Clan: 

You can RP any way you wish, but it must be non-violent in nature. This 
clan is about remaining out of the wars and conflicts. You can, however, 
try to facilitate peace between anyone--this is encouraged. You do not side 
with any other Clans, only mediate a peaceful resolution.

choose the path of the Bard, or storyteller. Agile, fortunate, and healthy,
though neither strong nor particularly trustworthy, a halfling makes for a 
curious (though somewhat underpowered) ally.

very hairy feet. Eye color range from blue, brown, green, and any shade

Happy hour is a staff toggle command that creates a global affect

For an hour, anybody IN A GROUP will gain triple experience from

both of these, people who are grouped while happy hour is on will
have their lag from skills and spells HALVED.

Got some chants that take ages to complete? No problem - during happy
hour, find a group and whip out the chant book. Want even more experience
than usual? During happy hour, find a group and get slaughtering. Got a
problem killing things over and over and getting no experience for them?

There is to be no multiplaying.  This is when one person has more then
one character online at the same time.  This also includes times when
a link dead character is left online and another character is brought online.

The first offense will be a warning.  The second will, however, be a slaying
or perhaps much much worse.  Do NOT multiplay. It is very much against the rules.

&YSyntax : human

With this toggle you can change to human form and back to your dragon form.

This skill calls upon ancient magic that the dragons all utilize.
Once called the dragon takes on human appearance, and is known by
others as a dragon lord.  They have a tell tale signature shadow of
a dragon cast by them in the sunlight.  

&WAdvantages:&c
They can wield weapons and use gear they normally could not as a dragon.  
They gain a cone skill instead of losing breath, based on the dragon's color.
They gain the fly spell instead of losing wings of the dragon.
They can enter areas and group/pkill others they could not before.  They
do have some limitations.

&WDisadvantages:&c
While in human form, or as Dragon Lords as other races call them, they
only receive 1/4 of normal experience they would.
Their hitpoints are less of what they are as a dragon.
The spells/skills they can use are very limited.
Cannot gain a level while in human form, you will keep your exp, but must
revert to dragon form, and gain one more exp point to activate the level.

Ignore someone who annoys you          : i3 ignore <person@mud>
Make yourself invisible to I3          : i3 invis

i3 chanlist: Lists the channels the mud has available to listen to.
  Specifying 'all' will list the channels for the entire network.

i3 listen  : Tunes you in to the specified channel. You must meet or
  exceed whatever the minimum level is for that channel to do so,
  and your mud must have the channel configured locally.

i3 chanwho : Shows you who is listening to the specified channel on the
  specified mud. Invisble players will not be shown.

i3 mudlist : Lists the muds which are connected to the network.
  Specifying a filter will narrow the list down to only those muds
  whose information matches. IE: &Wi3 mudlist smaug&D will list all
  muds who have &Wsmaug&D as part of their listing.

i3 mudinfo : Lists the information provided by the specified mud.

i3 ignore  : Allows you to selectively ignore all contact with person@mud.
  This will block tells, beeps, locates, fingers, emotes, and whos. It will also
  block channel output from them, but will NOT block them from seeing YOU on
  a channel.

i3 invis   : Makes you invisible to I3. Performs similar to the ignore option
  except it prevents EVERYONE on the network from finding you. You will still
  be able to use channels, and you will NOT be invisible to others if you
  do so.

101 1232321032 'IFCHECK ISTAGGED'~
Example: 	if istagged($n,testflag)
mpe $n is tagged with the 'testflag' variable.

If the target mob or char is tagged with the variable 'testflag' it will return true, 
regardless of the variable's value.

Example: 	if istagged($n,testflag) == bob
mpe $n's 'testflag' variable's value is 'bob'.

If the target mob or char is tagged with the variable 'testflag' which has a value of 
'bob', it will return true.

Example: 	if istagged($n,testflag) >= 10
mpe $n's 'testflag' variable's value is >= 10.

If the target mob or char is tagged with the variable 'testflag' which has a numerical 
value greater or equal to 10, it will return true.

The ISTAGGED ifcheck can be used in MOB, OBJECT, or ROOM programs to determine if the 
target char or mob has been tagged with a specified variable, and to test the value of 
that variable as well. When used with a numeric value, it can be tested using ">", "<", 
etc., as well.

Note: While you can use ISTAGGED to check for the presence of a bitflag, you must use the 
'ISFLAGGED' ifcheck to check the flag's value.

Syntax:  ignore
Syntax:  ignore <character>
Syntax:  ignore reply/none
 
Ignore allows you to ignore other characters in the Realms.  All tells,
says, socials, and emotes from these characters will be blocked (gagged
out).  You will still see their communications through public channels,
however.
 
Simply typing ignore will give you a list of all the characters you are
currently ignoring.
 
Ignore <character> allows you to add or remove a character from your list
of ignored players.  If the name is already on the list it will be removed.
If the name is not on the list it will be added.  Note that only the names
of actual characters will be accepted and that it is not necessary for
them to be logged on at the time.
 
Ignore reply will cause you to ignore the last person to send you a tell.
This can be used to prevent invisible people from spamming you.
 
Ignore none will set you to ignoring no one.

At current time, there are 14 "positions" in the game. Positions
are in a special order.  If position b is below position a on the
list, that indicates that while in position b, you have more 
physical or mental energy to spend on a task, be it a command,
a spell, or a skill.
 
For example, while standing, you have a greater ability to do things
than while sitting.  While fighting evasively, you have more options
than while fighting aggressively.

This is the type of instrument. 1 is woodwind, 2 is strings, 3 is brass,
4 is drums.&R
v1 - tune&W
This does NOT need to be set. It will increase as the instrument gets out
of tune. An experienced bard will be able to reduce it by tuning.&R
v2 - condition&W
This does NOT need to be set. It will increase as the instrument is
damaged (by inexperienced playing). Instruments can be repaired by a bard
&Wand the right materials.&R
v3 - bonusdmg&W
This CAN be set if needed. It is a way of making instruments more unique
(songs played with this instrument will do +X damage). Usually 0, but can
be set to 5 or 10 (or more for high level instruments) if needed.&R
v4 - bonusstat&W
This CAN be set if needed. It is a way of making instruments more unique
(songs played with this instrument will buff +X to each stat). Usually 0,
but can be set to 1 or 2 (or more for high level instruments) if needed.
&Rv5 - reset level&W
Same as every other object. If you want the instrument to be at an EXACT
level and never change, set this value (might randomise as +1 or -1 levels).
&Rv6 - element&W
VERY RARE. Instrument actually has an element type based on the below -
1) Fire  2) Cold  3) Electricity  4) Energy  - Again, this is a very rare
thing for an instrument to have, so would prefer only a few instruments in
the game to even support an element and they're the sort of thing to be
death dropped by bosses, not bought in stores.

1 1214899037 INT INTELLIGENCE~
Intelligence (INT in your 'score') represents your character's mental
capacity.  Among other things, it affects:
 
 - heavily influences the amount of mana a character gains at level
 
 - affects the amount of mana regenerated or recovered at each tick
   if a character is resting or sleeping
 
 - the rate at which a character learns or lands a new skill or spell
 
 - the percentage rate at which a character practices a new language
 
Intelligence is an important factor in learning between combatants.  If
a character fights a creature several times, the more intelligent of the
two opponents will gain an advantage over time...
 
Intelligence is the prime attribute of the mage.
 
~

108 1209820442 INTEGER~
Integer Number Variables 

The first type of variable we need to know about is of class type int 
- short for integer. 
An int variable can store a value in the range -32768 to +32767. 
You can think of it as a largish positive or negative whole number: 
no fractional part is allowed. To declare an int you use the instruction: 

int a;

To assign a value to our integer variable we would use the following C statement:

a=10;

The C programming language uses the "=" character for assignment. A statement of 
the form a=10; should be interpreted as take the numerical value 10 and store it 
in a memory location associated with the integer variable a. The "=" 
character should not be seen as an equality otherwise writing statements of the form:

a=a+10;

will get mathematicians blowing fuses! This statement should be interpreted as take 
the current value stored in a memory location associated with the integer variable a; 
add the numerical value 10 to it and then replace this value 
in the memory location associated with a.

0 1122239142 INTERMUD3~
Intermud-3 is a protocol which allows you to chat with people on
other muds who are also connected to Intermud-3. It is primarily
populated by LP based muds at this time, but the hope is to get
more Diku based muds to join over time. While some may say that
Diku based muds would be better served on the IMC Network, it
is far easier for a mud to obtain a connection to the Intermud-3
network, and the commands to use it are generally simpler.
The protocol itself is also cleaner and much less prone to attack.
In either case, should a mud desire it, Intermud-3 will coexist
peacefully with an IMC enabled mud. Currently, there is limited
support for cross-network traffic. This includes some channels,
private tells, and mudlists from either network. This may or may
not be expanded in the future.

Syntax: ipcompare <name>

This takes * as a wild card.
Ipcompare will compare online users to search for multiplayers. A positive
match using ipcompare does not always mean it is a multiplayer..but shows
that there are more than one user from a site on simultaneously.
Ipcompare <field> <#> will limit the output to x number of lines based on #.
* may be used as a wild card, for example ipcompare 107.18.3.* will return
matches from any that begin with the ip prior to the asterisk.
Ipcompare <field> <room|area|world> will limit the search based on that
criteria.  The room|area|world limitation will be judged on the room that
the immortal issued the command in.  So if you are in a different area
than the victim, it will show only players matching the site in the area
you are in.

This quest is intended to be completed without the aid of other dragons,
or any other race.  Receiving aid on the quest will forfeit your lair.  The
entrance to the quest can be found somewhere within Forbidden City.

If you manage to retrieve the dragon crest, give it to a STAFF member that 
is at least level 103, and they will credit you with the quest completion 
so you may be rewarded with your own lair. 

Your lair consists of one room, where you may store as many things as you
want to.  You will be able to provide input on the description of your lair.

Note: Don't expect to complete the quest at level 20, it is very difficult,
      and may take many tries to complete.

102 1122239142 LOADUP~
Syntax:  loadup <player>
 
LOADUP allows one to load up a player's character (playing or not), to do
whatever needs be done to the character.  (Modifying a flag, changing a
password... etc).  Use FORCE to make the character do your bidding.
 
If we make any changes to the char, we comment the char and place a note in
their inventory explaining who loaded them up and what changes were made.
The character is transed to room 99 and forced to quit there (unless they
are going to be left in hell).  If we don't make any changes to the char, we
trans them back from where they came and force quit them there.  Loadup is
used primarily when a player quits to avoid dealing with immortals or if
they quit before you finish writing a comment.  But it is also used to
investigate chars for duping and other allegations made against them.
 
So... there is actually a wide range of reasons to use loadup and you are
encouraged to use your discretion in this area.
 
If you load up a character to slay or purge them, you must post in 1205.

0 1214740874 'LOCATE OBJECT'~
&YSyntax: cast 'locate object' <item keyword(s)>
&c
This powerful spell will reveal the location of all items that resemble 
the one you were seeking information upon. 

The caster has to picture the item in his/her mind as good as possible, 
then with clearly spoken words, he/she will send a powerful probe outward, 
that will search the globe. After an amount of time it will return and 
enter the caster's mind, filling it with places and locations of where 
such item can be found. 

Needless to say, the more accurate the thought, the more clearer the 
picture, the less garbage one will receive as result. 

&OFor e.g. : cast locate red&c - will reveal a lot of red items
&OFor e.g. : cast locate red-nose&c - will reveal items with keyword red and nose (if any exist)

101 1122239142 LOG SNOOP~
Syntax: log   <character>
Syntax: log   all
Syntax: snoop <character>

LOG <character> causes all of a character's commands to be logged into
the server's log file.  Like FREEZE, it is a permanent character toggle.

Certain commands (PASSWORD) are protected against LOG.  Conversely, certain
commands (especially immortal commands) are always logged.

LOG ALL logs all character commands.  It is a server-wide toggle; it does not
persist across reboots.

SNOOP shows you a copy of all the input and output going to a character.
The character must have an open channel.  You may snoop more than one
character at a time.
The input from the player will be displayed with a header of the players 
name and a percentage sign (i.e. Mudder%)
SNOOP yourself to cancel all outstanding snoops.
-- Do not snoop people being intimate. <i.e. Mudsex, voyeurism, etc...>
-- Do not repeat information learned in snoop casually, especially to mortals
-- Only snoop a person talking to a higher level Immortal with the higher
   Immortals "Express Permission".
-- If a higher level Immortal begins communication with someone you are
     snooping, inform that higher Immortal immediately of the snoop.
-- Any incidental references learned in snoop should be disregarded
    ** For example, you hear someone is having a mud affair, it is not
    ** important to the reason you are snooping.  Do not judge or pass
    ** on information learned in this manner.
-- "Spot check" snooping of lower level Immortals is part of being a higher
   level immortal.  All Immortals may be snooped at any time, for any reason.
-- Do not snoop for the purpose of gaining information for personal reasons.
-- Being an Immortal is a privilege and a job.  Snoop is a tool to assist
   you do your job properly.  Snoop is neither a toy nor a right.

The lycanthrope, more commonly known as the Werewolf is the cross between

This change in racial attributes occurs primarily at night when the moon
is high and full, but some have so mastered the skill that they can choose
to live as either race they prefer for so long as they wish to remain in such
form. The existance of these creatures is purely coincidental as only those who
are born with this ability may ever retain it. The likelyhood of a humanoid
infant possessing this rare but interesting condition is relatively rare but
as they share the same instinctual feelings wolves have for thier pack, these
lycanthrope tend to cluster together and form communities of thier own to
support one another.

facility when things began to happen in other parts of the schools.
the priests, and priestesses where both trained to combat evil in
the best way available. 

Not long after the School of Shadows was over run by the demons the Mausoleum
was taken by the forces of evil as well.  This place has been cursed by the
very presence of the evil within.  Those poor souls that where stuck within
the walls when it was transformed found themselves also transformed to match
their surroundings and now inhabit this unholy place with the urge to destroy.

&gYour mental state is your current frame of mind, and how clearly and
realistically you view your surroundings.  Mental states can be affected
by prolonged combat, hunger, thirst, or poison.  If you are affected by
one of the above for a period of time, your mental state will begin to
deteriorate, and you will not view your surroundings as they truly are.
You may begin to hallucinate, or become too lethargic to function, and
your general abilities will be affected.  In extreme cases you may
collapse from exhaustion or enter a delirious coma.
 
To restore your mental state, you may need to rest (resting and sleeping
will speed your recovery), eat, cure whatever poison afflicts you, etc.
Note that if you are malnourished your state will &wnot&g improve, even with
sleep, until you have fed and/or quenched your thirst.
 
Your mental state can be observed with the &WSTATUS&g command which describes 
your state of mind (You feel great, etc.)  The 'group' display contains a less

have an arrow in inventory.
 
See help &Wfire and help &Wfletch

101 1193000881 MISSILES~
Creating a projectile is basically the same as making any other
weapon. The exception to this are its Values (see ITEMVALUES)
and the need to have missiles which match missileweapons.
 
&GFollow this basic proceedure to make a set of projectiles&W:
  1) Create a firing mechanism, for instance, a long bow.
  2) Set the itemtype to 'missileweapon'.
  3) Set the wearflags to 'take missile'
  4) Set the projectile values from the HELP PROJECTILES table.
 
&G Now the wielded weapon is done, but you need something to fire...&W
  1) Create a shootable object, for instance, an arrow.
  2) Set the itemtype to 'projectile'
  3) Set the wearflags to 'take'.
  4) Set the projectile values from the HELP PROJECTILES table.
 
Don't forget to finish the items with weight, cost, long, short etc.
You now have two objects in inventory which are ready to fire.
Lastly, you may create a quiver for certain objects. To do this,
set the itemtype to 'quiver', and use v0 to set its capacity.
Be sure not to set the capacity too high, as quivers should be small.

1 1216436300 MONTHS SEASONS~
As days turn into months and months turn into years, the mud will see
changes come into season - trees will shed leaves, flowers will grow,
snow falls in winter and the sun beats down in summer. Cities also
celebrate different holidays across the year.

There are sixteen months in the Paleon Calendar:

Months of SPRING - the Grand Struggle, Renewal, Nature, Hope
Months of SUMMER - the Dragon, the Sun, the Heat, the Battle
Months of FALL - West Winds, the Long Shadows, Futility, the
  Ancient Darkness
Months of WINTER - the Great Evil, the Winter Wolf, the Frost
  Giant, the Old Forces

In addition to this, certain spells (ie elemental spells that use fire and
cold as attacking forces) will vary across the seasons. Trying to cast a
fireball in the middle of winter for example, would not be as effective as
when the weather is warmer. By the same principle, a blizzard in winter will
be twice as powerful and may cause 'chain reaction' storms.

MPFLAG   MPRMFLAG

Syntax: MPFLAG <victim> <flag> <value>
Syntax: MPRMFLAG <victim> <flag> <value>

Using these commands you can assign variables based on 128 "bits". These bits 
work like "On/Off" switches and may be assigned by any mob. A typical mpflag 
will look like :

testing:3=[1]

"testing" is the name of the flag, "3" is the vnum of the mob that assigned 
the flag, and the "[1]" is the bit that is enabled. When more than one bit is 
enabled, it will look more like:

testing:3=[1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1]

In this case, bits 1 and 11 are enabled, 2-10 are disabled. To make use of 
these flags, use the "isflagged" ifchecks. Mpflags will be assigned to a 
player for a mobs "level X intelligence". The flag will save when the 
character saves and will continue to exist for this amount of time "mudtime". 
You can also set the timer for a tag using the commands "noexpire" or "timer".

Example: mpflag noexpire $n <flag> [value]
Example: mpflag timer <#> $n <flag> [value]

If no timer is designated, the timer is set based on the mobs intelligence 
multiplied by the mobs level.

nothing to be purged, the command will log a bug.  To purge an item 
from a player's inventory silently, use the above syntax.  However, 
using the item name instead of the ovnum may result in the purging of
unintended items.  Recommended to use the ovnum at all times. 

Also, make sure to use &WIFCHECK ISCARRYING&c so that no bugs result.

101 1122239142 MPSTAT~
Syntax:  mpstat <mob/mobvnum>
 
Mpstat will display all of the mobprograms that have been written for the
specified mob.  If an instance of that mob exists in the game, it can be
accessed with its vnum.

101 1232321423 MPTAG MPRMTAG~
MPTAG  MPRMTAG

Syntax: MPTAG <victim> <tag> [value]
Syntax: MPRMTAG <victim> <tag>

Using these commands, you can assign a "tag", or "variable" to a character, 
either just the tag, or the tag and a value associated with it.

The "tag" can be both a "string variable" (a group of characters, or words) 
or an "integer" variable, a number. If using a number you can use the ifcheck 
"istagged" to compare how big or little the number is using <>= operators.

The tag assigned to a character will last on the character based on the mob's 
intelligence and level that assigned it. (eg: INT x LEVEL ) So a level 10 mob 
with an intelligence of 13 will tag for a length of 130 ticks. These tags 
will save to a characters pfile and will last over logging out and logging in. 
You can also set the timer for a tag using the commands "noexpire" or "timer".
Example: 	mptag noexpire $n <tag> [value]
  	mptag timer <#> $n <tag> [value]

You can additionally specify a vnum to be associated with a particular tag. 
Tagging a mob with the 0 vnum allows all mobs to see/modify that tag.
Example: 	mptag $n <tag>:<vnum> [value]
  	mptag $n <tag>:0 [value]

Mprmtag can also be used to clear all bits of a particular mpflag. 
See MPFLAG for more information.

~

101 1122239142 MSET~
Syntax: mset <character> <field> <value>
        mset character on
 
MSET sets the properties of mobiles. If a mobile has the PROTOTYPE flag, 
modifying an instance of this mobile will also modify the index mobile, which 
all other instances of the mobile are based on.
 
MSET ON will lock you onto a particular mob/character. Once locked on, all
mset commands will imply 'mset <character>'. Hitting enter while in MSET ON
will give you an mstat of the mob/character you are working on. To get out
of MSET ON, simply type the word DONE. Example:
 
        mset gracca on
        long A large hulking figure stands here.
        sex 1
        done

-1 1280270633 MULTICLASS~
&cMulticlass in 6 dragons is done in such a way as to attempt game balance.  
Balance in power is important to us.  When you choose multiclass, we will ask 
you if you'd like a second class, or a third class.  You may choose to be 
dual classed or triple classed.  Realize that the balance occurs primarily at
level 100.

Single classes have the advantage of leveling much more quickly, and gaining
a health bonus over dual and triple classes.  Single class casters get a bonus
to damage of their magic spells they cast.  Single class may receive spells/skills
that are more potent then dual, and tripleclass.  Also each additional class you
take the lower the maximum that it is possible to adept that spell/skill will be.

Dual classes have a health bonus over triple classes, but not as big a bonus 
as single classes do.  They do level quicker than triple classes, however.
Dual/Triple class casters that do not have a warrior-like class in their combo
get a damage bonus to the spells they cast.  

Keep in mind that the combination you choose will affect the abilities and
attributes you receive.  For example, it is recommended that new players
go with a warrior (or similar) type class for their first class, as this 
will grant them greater health.

of colored light swirling around you faster and faster...

Your soul is bursting with emotions you can barely conceive...
You feel a burning inside... both cold and hot... a tingle of electricity
grows into a powerful buzzing surge jolting through every inch of your body.

&cSyntax:  &Cname <newname>

&cThis command allows a pre-authorization player to change their name to
a new one if their original choice has been denied.
  Example: A new player named Pete has his name denied. To change his
  name to 'Dakagar', Pete would simply type: &cname Dakagar&c.

When choosing a name, please try to choose one which is both medieval
and unique. Good names help add to gameplay and will allow you to forge
an identity for yourself. Simply put, your name should NOT be:

 - Nonsensical, unpronounceable or ridiculous.
 - 3 letters or less.
 - Profane or derogatory as interpreted in any language.
 - Futuristic or common, such as 'Jill' or 'Laser'.
 - Similar to that of any 6 Dragons STAFF, major mob, or equipment.
 - Significant in history, mythology, or any religion.
 - Comprised of various capital letters, such as 'BrACkkA' or 'CORTO'.
 - Comprised of ranks or titles, such as 'Lord' or 'Master'.
 - Composed of singular descriptive nouns, adverbs or adjectives,
    as in 'Heart', 'Big', 'Flying', 'Broken', 'Slick' or 'Tricky'.
 - Any of the above in reverse, i.e., writing Jade as 'Edaj'.
 - Any combination of singular descriptive nouns/adverbs or adjectives, as
   in 'Metaljacket Heartbound Earthstone or Softheart'.
 - A noun (place or thing) such as 'GrandCanyon', 'Cat', 'Rock', to include
   words meaning the same thing in another language.
 - Any of the above in an anagram format.  i.e. 'Travel' as "Tevral"

Please keep in mind that names which were authed in the past do
not validate current name authing. Above are the guidelines
which all STAFF follow. In addition, they may have their own
reasons for denying your name. The final determination as to the
validity of a name on 6 Dragons is the discretion of the STAFF member
and is NOT subject to debate or discussion. If your name is denied,
simply follow the guidelines and try a new one.

101 1215919868 NEWDIGFLAG~
Slight change to the 'DIG' exflag - you can now use it on its own to 
create a 'collapsed' passage. This passage can NOT be moved through (like 
it just isn't there) until it is successfully dug out, then it can be 
entered by anyone. The DIG flag will come up as a reset also, so you can 
have a passage reset as collapsed. The 'dig' skill will also dig through 
the passage from the OTHER side, so if you create an exit west to room 
101, and in room 101 create a DIG exit east, digging either direction will 
open both. The only problem then is if a player is IN the passage during 
reset, they might not be able to get back out, heh. 

&RSORRY NOT CREATE A PASSAGE - PLAYERS CAN'T CREATE PASSAGES. Basically I
meant if you have an exit to a room flagged 'dig', players won't see it. But
if they DIG in that direction, they can uncover the passage into the room
(and back). And if you instaroom so the DIG FLAG goes into the resets, every
reset it will collapse that passage again.

channels, respectively.  Characters who are notelled will also not receive
those forms of communication.
 
Use UNSILENCE to remove a player's silence.  Simple use notell, noemote or
notitle on the character again to remove each of those restrictions.

&WSyntax:
      &cunnuisance  <victim>
      &cnuisance    <victim> [options]
&GUnnuisance will remove the nuisance flag from a player.
Nuisance will add a nuisance flag to the player specified by victim.
&wThis only works on pc's.  The optional parameters are as follows:
  &cmaxtime <#> <minutes/days/hours>&w
         &wThe maxstage of nuisance. Default is 8 days.
  &ctime <#>&w:  The time in days that the nuisance flag will stay on the
         player, once the time is expired the flag will automatically be
         removed. If this option is not used it will default to a permenant
         penalty.
  &cpower <#>&w:  A number from 1 to 10, 10 being the worst for the player.

&WNote the words before the options are not optional and must be used.

&RExamples:  &cnuisance mortal maxtime 5 days time 7 power 5
&GThis would nuisance mortal for 7 days with the maximum stage being
reached in 5 days, at a power level of 5.  Also note you can leave options
out:  &cnuisance mortal maxtime 5 days power 5 &Gfor example would set the
maximum time to reach the final stage at a power level 5 and use the default
value for the time.  Also options can be rearranged n like:
&cnuisance mortal power 5 maxtime 5 days time 7 &Gwould be the same as the
first example.
&GTo see info on nuisance level, power and set time of a player, use &WMSTAT.

Syntax: oscatter area count object (hide/bury)

This allows the staff member to randomly load an item through

example: oscatter manoake.are 50 14000

The above example would load object 14000 in manoake.are in 50
random places. You can also use the options HIDE or BURY (at the
end) to hide or bury the items. Bury will only place them in
sectors where you can actually dig, so be careful using that
option in city areas (roads are HARD!).

101 1240205501 OSET~
&cSyntax:  oset <object>    <field> <value>

If the copy of the object you are currently modifying has the PROTOTYPE flag,
your modifications will also modify the index of that object, which all other
instances of the object are based on.  In the future, every copy of that obj
will reflect your modifications.

Also be aware that modifications to the object affect list (everything that
is listed after 'object values') will affect _every_ copy of that object in
the game, including old copies (even if they are not online).  Thus if you
change a prototype-flagged copy of a sword to +4 damroll, every copy of that
vnum ever made will reflect that change.  If you add a 'magic' flag to that
sword, however, only copies made after the change will be affected.

If the copy of the object you are modifying does NOT have the PROTOTYPE flag,
your modifications will affect only that copy.

OSET ON will lock you onto a particular object.  Once locked on, all commands
commands will imply 'oset <object>'.  Hitting enter while in OSET ON gives
you an ostat of the object you are working on.  To get out of OSET ON, simply
type the word DONE. Example:

        oset staff on
        long A long gnarled staff of burnished oak lies here.
        type staff

0 1122239142 PASSWORD~
Syntax:  password  <new password>   <new password>
 
PASSWORD changes your character's password.  You repeat the new password only.
If you do not get it correctly it will not work.  This should end the typo
locking you out of your character.
The PASSWORD command is protected against being snooped or logged; it is
impossible for any immortal to in any way see, find or retrieve it.  It
is the responsibility of the player to ensure that the password of the
character is kept secure.
 
Passwords can not contain certain characters, or spaces.  We also advise
that you use an alphanumeric password (one containing both numbers and
letters) as they are harder to guess.  We also recommend that you choose
a password that is greater than 6 characters in length.  A good rule of
thumb is if it is in the dictionary, it is probably not a good password.
 
NOTE:  if you decide to trade a character, you do so at your own risk.
Immortals are not responsible for ensuring fair trades.  You may seek an
immortal to oversee a trade, but it is not their  responsibility.
 
&YThe password policy is:  password equals ownership.&w

2 1122239142 PASSWORD_ZMUD~
When you're using zMUD and want to change your password, remember to change

for this is:  password <new password> <new password>
In zMUD, click on 'File', then 'Another Character', or 'File', then 'Open'
to access the character settings - and change the password there.
If you have forgotten your character's password but can still log on with
the character, you can still find out what the password is.  Log on with
that character, click on 'View', then 'Preferences' and then click on
General Settings'.  Find the checkbox for 'Gag Password' and make sure the
box is not checked.  Click on 'Ok' to close the dialog box.
Type the command #say %pass [enter].  Your password will be shown on your
screen, but not sent to the mud.  Write it down, for future reference.

percentage starts off at 0% (unlearned), and can be practiced as many
times as you have practices. The amount of strength/dexterity you have 
determines how high percent you can practice a skill. The amount of 
intelligence/wisdom determines how high you can practice a spell.
   
After this initial practice, the skill/spell must be used to develop it 
to the level of 'adept'--adept is not always necessarily 100%.  You must 
be at a teacher to practice.

Projectiles are wielded weapons which allow players to hit victims
without being in the same room. Projectiles have several forms, those
being bow & arrow; crossbow & bolt; sling & stone; peashooter & pebble:
tube & dart. All are used in a similar manner.
 
You must first be wielding the weapon which will perform the action
of firing the intended object. To do this, simply 'wield <weaponname>
missile'. This will place the bow, sling or other firing mechanism
in the location 'missile wielded', which you will see when you type 'eq'.
 
You must have a type of projectile in your inventory, this being an arrow,
rock, bolt, pebble or other projectile(s).
 
You must have practiced 'missile weapons' in order to wield a firing
mechanism. If you do not practice it, you will not be able to fire.
 
Lastly, provided you have a projectile in inventory, and a firing
weapon wielded in the 'missile wielded' position, you are ready to
try out your new projectile.
 
Note that firing a weapon at another player will result in a pkill
attempt, which can have severe consequences. If you and your mortal
target are not both listed under "Who Deadly", you will be confronted
by an immortal for your actions and flagged as a violater of Realms
Law. See &YLaws Pkill&W for more information on players vs. players.

fish.  This area is mainly suggested at 35th level and up. I would
advise you take care if you do make in as these creatures are quite
strong. You will also want to come prepared with aqua breath. Also
make note that there is only ONE exit from this place.

Rekey changes the keyword of an item.
It differs from rename in that it is not the name that is seen, but the
name the object is identified as and can be looked at or picked up as.
For example, if a sword of legend was rekeyed to blade , get sword would
no longer work with this item. (get blade would pick up the item)

   When an item is rekeyed, one of the words from the short description
     &GMUST&W be used in the rekey.

1 1122239142 RENAME~
A rename may be done by a level 54 or higher immortal.  If you wish
for the rekey to be completed at the same time, you must contact a
level 56 or higher immortal.  The rename can be purchased with 20
glory or a rename scroll.  Wedding renames are done with a marriage
license by Blorin, the Darkhaven engraver.  (See help wedding)
Renames are to be medieval in style for mortals and must not contain
the name of an immortal without their expressed consent.  Items will
not be renamed to machine gun, silly putty, etc.
Before contacting an immortal to redeem glory or scrolls for a rename,
please have in mind what you would like done.  You will need to consider
the following:
Short description - what is seen when the item is worn by a person.
Long description - what is seen when the item is lying on the ground.
Rekey - the renaming of the item (usually something from the short desc)

108 1210273424 RENUMBER~
&YSyntax: renumber <area filename> <new vnum base> [flags]
Flags: fillgaps verbose
&pExample: renumber haon.are 6100 fillgaps verbose&w

The renumber command renumbers an entire area to a new vnum base. All rooms,
objects and mobs will be renumbered, and all references to them will be fixed 
(changed to reflect the new vnum for each object/mob/room). These references 
include: resets, exits, shops, repair shops, and the objvals of some objects 
(containers and levers). 

Unless the "&pfillgaps&w" flag is supplied, the command doesn't fill vnum gaps. 
If you just want to fill the gaps in the area instead of changing the vnum 
base, simply supply the same vnum base (duh!). 

If the "&pverbose&w" flag is not supplied the command will simply report 
the actions. If it's supplied, it will also list all the vnum changes, and
report details on all the reference fixes.

The command will only modify references inside the area, except for two-way
exits leading into the area, wich will be listed if the "&wverbose&p" flag is
supplied (so that you know that you also have to save those areas). 

Mobprogs can also contain references to vnums, but since prog parsing is
far beyond this command, all it does is perform simple string searches and 
warn you if it finds any (possible) references, and it only does this if
the "verbose" flag is supplied. This search is performed only in the progs
inside this area, not in every mudprog in the game.

In conclusion, &Gall references are modified by the command except&w:
	&p* &Gresets in other areas for things being renumbered
	&p* &Greferences to these vnums in mobprogs in other areas
	&p* &Gone-way entrances to the area

1 1122239142 REPOP~
Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if there are no characters in
in the area; less often (15 minutes) if any characters are present.  Also
note that objects lying on the ground will not be regenerated if anyone
is in the area when it resets.
 
Area resets are indicated by 'squeaking noises' just prior to the reset.
~

104 1126018446 RESERVE~
The "Reserve" command enables us to specify certain names that are
reserved and cannot be used by players.
 
We can specify names that we want to reserve because they belong to
former imms (like Narn and Dominus). We can specify names that are
often tried and are a bit of a pain (like Killer or Satan or Seth).
 
We can specify parts of names by preceding the string with an "*">
e.g.  reserve *goof
This will prevent any name with the substring "goof" ... like ...
"goofface", "biggoof" or "biggoofface".
All deity names should be reserved.
 
reserve                        list current reserved names
reserve joe                    add joe to the list if he's not on it
reserve joe                    remove joe to the list if he is on it
Syntax: reserve <name> [add / remove]

The purpose of it, is to reward STAFF members that have just accomplished 
something for the game.  I believe it is the fairest way to do this, as we 
are not giving STAFF any super gear, or bonuses, only compensating them for 
the time they put into the game, by giving them double experience hour 
rewards to help catch up to players that don't have to spend time working 
for the game.  &WThis command is not to be talked about to players, although, 
it is not anything I would be ashamed of, I just don't want to have to explain 
it, and then have them wondering if we are doing other things.&c
 
Explain to STAFF that you reward before you reward them, that they are not to 
talk about it to other players.  The command is used on the STAFF who was deemed 
worthy alternate player they pick, it must be an alt of the said STAFF member 
and can never be used on a regular player that isn't STAFF.  Rewarding shall be
simular to giving you back the time you spent on a task with double experience.  
You can reward based on the following reasons:
&W 
1.  STAFF member just completed 10 rooms completely to building guideline standards.
2.  STAFF member just created 10 mobiles completely to building guideline standards.
3.  STAFF member just created 10 objects completely to building guideline standards.

&cOnce you figured out your character, it's time to get acquainted with 
the stories of the world. What happened in its history? Are there any 
major events taking place? How will you take part in it? Read up on the 
story as much as you can and decide how you can change history to the 
better or the worse, whatever you desire. 

&cAfter picturing yourself in this time, in this place, in this world ... 
it's time to act accordingly. Roleplaying is more than writing a bio and 
description. 

You could address people with titles such as Milady, Sir, Milord, 
Madam,Mistress, Lady, General, ... . 

You can speak of great adventures that you were part of, and tell about 
them to others. You can speak of your chosen class, the crafts and talents 
you have. Roleplaying is simply, playing a role in a certain environment. 
Participate actively in an ongoing story and decide its course together 
with others. It's a chance to explore another part of yourself ... perhaps 
think of something you always wanted to be ... or of what your favorite 
part would be in a medieval time setting. Would you be a goodie two shoes, 
a villain, a duke, a general of an army, a wealthy citizen or merely a 
peasant of a village? Whatever you choose to be, act like it. Citizen 
don't tend to be too brave and mouthy, dukes aren't likely to take orders 
from those underneath him.... . 

Roleplaying isn't obligated, but highly encouraged as it adds another 
aspect to mudding. Roleplaying mostly happens between players in the same 
room, but it also can happen over &wicc&c.

1 1197870172 ROOMDESC~
&WHow to write room descriptions.

For example, perhaps you want to describe a cottage. Here
are some questions you can ask yourself.

Is it a small cottage or a big cottage? (Small)

What do you envision inside the cottage? (Homely cottage,
with the image of something boiling..maybe dinner?)

Anything else in the cottage? (&YPots&W, &Ychairs&W..)

Something else to mention (Perhaps the &Yceiling&W).

Finished Product:

Smoke fills the air in this small dwelling. A small pot can
be seen placed over a fire pit here, with some chopped up
ginseng roots inside. Rattan chairs are placed about the room,
along with several clay-like objects scattered over the place.
Sunlight streams into the abode from the holes in the thatched
ceiling.

How about the descriptions?

&YSmoke&W: A thin hazy wisp of smoke filters into the air.

&YPot&W: Some hot broth fills the pot, mixed with the ginseng
roots.

&YGinseng roots&W: These roots are rumoured to cure all illnesses
and maladies.

&YFire pit&W: This pit is commonly used to cook food in the village.

&YRattan chairs&W: They are made out of rattan bound and twined
together. It serves as a durable, yet itchy seatrest.

&Yobjects&W: These clay-like objects were moulded together by the
children of this cottage in their free time.

&Yhole&W: The straw thatching the roof gets worn after time, leaving
behind many holes on the ceiling.

&Yceiling&W: It is a ceiling thatched with straw.

Voila, a room description!&D

2 1212952462 RP 'ROLE PLAY' 'roleplay' ROLEPLAYING~
&cFirst of all, a little explaining on the atmosphere of this world. It is 
based on medieval times. Medieval is a time period of lore, magic, 
warriors, dragons,... and everything you have ever imagined. Times were 
simple, things like cars, tv, radio, and all of those DID NOT exist. Try 
to imagine yourself out in the middle of nowhere, with no technology and 
then you have the basics of medieval. There were courts and castles and 
magicians and heroes and knights and dragons and monsters of all sorts. 
Medieval is riding horses and carriages or walking by foot to get to your 
destination. If you are a magic user it could mean portals or rifts 
through time. Treachery and thievery could be a way of life, as could 
being a courtly lord or lady. 

Secondly, look at your character. Did you pick good, evil or neutral? How 
about a warrior, a healer, someone who manipulates the dead, someone who 
derives power from the earth, etc. Look at exactly who you picked to be... 
and &Wbecome that person&c. If your name is derived from something you 
read in a book, then take on their actions, their morals..it's a 
game..it's pretending to be someone else... you become that person. Ask 
yourself, what does a cleric mean to me, or a warrior, or a necromancer, 
or a mage..and become those.. make it fun ...immerse yourself in this 
world of fantasy.

    Deadlies may not multiplay.  Deadlies can never be logged on same time 
    a peaceful alt is, nor can they use their peaceful alts to scan for 
    victims with farsight, etc.  Violators are subject to punishment.
2.  Keep ALL profanity to the swear channel or risk being silenced.
3.  Do NOT spam. If any level of STAFF ask you to desist on a subject or 
    to move it to another channel, do so immediately. See &WHELP SPAM&c
4.  WARNING: Arguing with or flaming STAFF on public channels WILL
    get you silenced or worse. This may extend to your other characters
    if you push the issue. We provide ample avenue for complaint via gnotes
    forums and email directly to Heads of Councils or Vladaar. Public baiting
    and name-calling will NOT be tolerated.
5.  Know the player killing laws whether you are one or not. See &WHELP PKILL LAWS&c
6.  Do not ask about staff commands, how the MUD works, or other such behind-the-
    scenes topics. We are not a MUD building tutorial and have little patience for
    this. If you already know some SMAUG staff (immortal) commands, you must NEVER
    refer to them on public channels.
7.  Do not use charm, summon, or powers of ANY kind to bring aggressive mobs to
    Paleon or other homelands. Also do not bring any aggressive mob into ANY area
    that is lower in level than the area from which it came. Deadlies may do so but
    are TOTALLY responsible for the protection of peacefuls from said mob.
    Use the AREAS command to check the level of areas. See &WHELP CHARM&c
8.  AD ADVERTISING It is AGAINST the rules of this mud to advertise other online 
    games, be it on public channels or through tells, through your description, 
    title, biography or even by leaving notes on public boards or to someone in 
    private. If you are asked to desist and do not do so immediately, you might

    to kill. Should you notice a bug having to do with a shopkeeper that helps you get
    free or cheaper than usual items from them and you do not report it, you would be
    subject to &RSEVERE &cpenalties.
13. Applying to be a staff member should be a serious decision and should not be
    considered lightly. Besides being a lot of work for no pay, you may lose the
    magic of MUDding if you become STAFF. If, however, after thinking it over, you 
    still wish to become a STAFF, submit a gnote, describing why you think you would
    be valuable to Six Dragons, to the Head of the Council of most interest to you. If
    you don't know which Council of STAFF that you wish to work with, send your gnote
    to the Head of Player Relations, who will pass it along to the most suitable STAFF
    member for review, who will then contact you.
14. Botting.  It is not allowed here.  If you wish to create triggers/scripts to auto-level
    your character and skills, you MUST be present and monitoring what's going on.  If you
    are found to be away from your computer, SEVERE penalties await you.

The old head master of the school Lord Iufn was a kind man, but he was
also known to be very stern.  Not to long ago something bad happened 
within the school.  The great head master died a mysterious death that
none was able to explain, nor did anyone have any idea of what happened 
to his remains.

Not long after the fall of Iufn the school was over run with terrifying 
creatures of death, and destruction.  Without the great Iufn there to push
back to forces of darkness it was not long before the school was completely
under their control.  rumors began to circulate that perhaps Iufn himself
was the one responsible for bringing these creatures from the depths of
which they came from. 

However, the new head master of the school Curiner does not believe this to 
be the case.  Curiner is in high hopes that the light will prevail and that
champions of the light will come to rid their once well known school of the
fate it has come to know.

.
Seraphim are the femininely-depicted angels of the Celestial race, 
and the praised altos and sopranos of the choir of angels that fills
the Heavens. Rarely have these seraphim, or any angels, been seen by
mortal eyes, but they are imagined by painters and writers to be women
of beautiful figure and voice, often incensing hallowed grounds and 
praising the Gods.

103 1122239142 SETBOOT~
Syntax: setboot time <hour> <minute>
 	setboot manual <0|1>

The setboot command is useful for planning a reboot, (to save you from 
the trouble of all those echos :) ) and for the daily boot.  The manual
bit is used by the mud to determine whether the boot time was set by 
hand.  When the mud starts up, the boot time is set to 0600hrs (6am)
and the manual bit to 0.  If 'setboot time' is used, the mud sets the
manual bit to 1.  When it comes time to do the reboot, the mud checks
how long it has been running.  If it has been running less than 18 
hours and the reboot time has not been set manually, the reboot does
not take place (nor do the automatic warning echoes).

Echoes: when a scheduled reboot is coming up, the mud will send out
echoes to that effect.  The echoes start 30 minutes before the reboot
and are repeated at t minus 15, 10, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 minute(s).

105 1122239142 SETCHANNEL~
Syntax: setchannel <channel> <field> <value>

Field may be one of the following:
name level type history

Edits a channel's settings.

Name: Changes the name of the channel. This will cause the channel to become
      useless to anyone currently listening to it when the rename occurs.

Level: Specifies the minimum level at which people can hear or use the channel.

Type: Specifies the type of channel.
      Type can be one of the following: Global, Zone, Guild, Council, PK, and Log.

      Global channels can be used by everyone.
      Zone channels can only be used by people in the same area.
      Guild channels can only be used by people in guilds or clans.
      Council channels can only be used by people in councils.
      PK channels can only be used by Player Killers.
      Log channels can only be heard, not used. They are for system information.
	Log channels also require that the to_channel() function in channels.c be edited.

History: Specifies weather or not the channel retains a history. If it does,
         then the channel will keep the last 20 messages sent to it. Should
         probably not be used for anything other than global channels.
         Histories also require that the mxp.style file in the system
         directory be edited to accomadate it.

Syntax: setquest <quest> desc - Lets you describe the quest for journal <quest> show
Syntax: setquest <quest> skipchapters - lets you skip chapters with that quest.

Setquest will enable you to create set quests for every player in 6 Dragons.
Each player has a journal that displays the current quests available
to them at their level, as well as their current status in that quest and
whether they are under any time restrictions.

Using setquest, you can create a new quest, as well as set the minimum
level, amount of chapters and timelimit for the total quest. Chapters are
basically..
&Y
First you have to create the chapters ie. setquest <quest name> create

Secondly setquest <quest name> chapters <number> - that sets how many steps
there are in your quest.

Next type setquest <quest name> chapter <number> create - for each chapter
that creates the block so you can add descriptions like below.

&G
Chapter1: Speak to Santa Claus in The North Pole.
Chapter2: Find Santa Claus' bag of presents!
Chapter3: Return Santa's presents to him.
Chapter4: Find the culprit who stole the presents! Try talking to Volk.
Chapter5: Volk says you must kill Hitler!
Chapter6: Return to Santa after killing Hitler.
Chapter7: You were rewarded with 5000 gold for returning Santa's presents.

You can set each chapter name by typing 'setquest (questname) chapter (number)
name (name - ie Return to Santa)'.

Quests throughout the game are run on progs - mobprogs, objectprogs and
roomprogs - to start (chapter 0), advance (chapter ?) and complete the quest
(chapters + 1).

&YExample for completing a quest with 6 chapters:

mpquest $n <questname> 7

Next, &Csetquest <quest name> description&Y to set a quest description.

Next &Csetquest <quest name> level <level>&Y and 
&Csetquest <quest name> chapter <number> level <level> &Yso that players receive
experience for their completed quests.

Next, &Csetquest <quest name> svnum <vnum of room/obj/mob that starts the quest>&Y.

Next, &Csetquest <quest name> stype <0/1/2>&Y.

101 1155738437 SETSHARP~
Syntax: mset (weapon) value6 (percentage)

In a nutshell, weapons that can be sharpened (daggers, swords, spears,
knives, etc) depend on the value6 to determine how sharp they are.

A value of 0 represents weapons that haven't yet been sharpened - not
necessarily blunt, I would probably just say average.

A value of 1 means the weapon has been sharpened before, but is
extremely blunt. A value of 30 means the weapon is neither blunt nor
sharp - the same as having a value of 0. A value of 100 means the weapon
is as sharp as it can humanly be.

Sharpness modifies the minimum and maximum damage of the weapon (not
hit and numdice), based on the value 30 above. At value6 = 1, the weapon
damage will be modified by -29%. At value6 = 30, there will be no mods.
At value6 = 100, the weapon will gain an increase of 70%.

Basically it's: value6 - 30 = damage modifier %.

        immortal with access to SLAY can use it.
Color - Numerical value for the color of the messages sent.
        For now, use color 12 until a better method for setting colors
        can be found.
Cmessage - You will be put into the line editor to enter the message the
           user of the SLAY command will see.

-1 1237202220 SHADE~
SHADES

&cShades are one of the most unusual races, composed of living 
shadow rather than flesh. The presence of even one noticeably dims 
the surrounding area, and their homeland is always covered in 
gloomy night. Their semi-insubstantial nature also allows 
them to phase through most doors. They make capable warriors and 
mages, and their shadowy form and natural pass door ability makes 
them highly effective thieves. They are agile and smart.

Despite their decidedly cruel and immoral nature, shades have no 
allegiance to Tanzean'al, who presents as much a threat to them as 
the rest of the world. Many see the benefit in fighting Tanzean'al 
alongside the other kingdoms, but most are likely to seek profit 
from the chaos of the war via thievery or other underhanded means.

Base stats for shade before are the below, what class you chose will also
adjust your stats.

Syntax: sharpen <&Cweapon&c>

Just as slicing, slashing, stabbing and piercing weapons are only as good
as their points, edges and blades, they may be made deadlier when sharpened 
with the self-named skill. To sharpen a weapon correctly, you must have
high enough 'dexterity' and 'luck' to avoid damaging the blade.

Sharpen is based on a percentage from 0 (unsharpened) to 100 (sharpest possible).
Using this skill will increase the max damage that a weapon can do.

Sharpened weapons also have a chance to become 'blunt' during battle, and will
need to be re-sharpened.

Note: In order to &WSHARPEN&c a weapon, one must have a sharpening stone to hone
the blade upon.

Shield-Use

Holding a shield in battle will grant you protection from some blows.
When you wear a shield you cannot use a two-handed weapon, you cannot
dual wield another weapon, and you cannot hold an item.  Also when
your shield does absorb blows, it damages the shield.  Eventually if
the damage is too much the shield loses effectiveness until it is
repaired, or until it breaks completely.

&C
Spam is the repeated use of a phrase, command, or channel that causes screen 
scroll for others.  Not only is spam considered rude, but excessive screen scroll 
can interfere with the game play of anyone seeing it (especially in combat situations).  

The use of all-caps can also be considered spam.  Only use capitals to add emphasis 
to key words in a sentence.

Moving a large number of items into and out of a container in a crowded, 
non-store room is considered spam.  Making charmed mobs to cause screen scroll 
through movement or orders is considered spam. ANYTHING that causes excessive 
or irritating screen scroll can be considered spam.

Public channels are there for normal chit chat, but that does not mean that long
drawn out discussions on these channels is either polite, considerate, or even
appropriate or acceptable. If you find a discussion on a public channel turning
into a long debate, please suggest to those involved to take it to TELL (if only
two) or having everyone (if more than two) meet in a room so that you may use OSAY or
SAY commands to continue.

1 1122239142 'SPECTRAL FUROR' 'HAND OF CHAOS'~
After the Dark Mage Thanatos accidentally discovered the spell
'Disruption' in a failed attempt to create a teleportation magic,
he spent many years studying how to increase the pain that can
be inflicted by incorrectly moving a victim across the threshold
of dimensions.  
 
 'Spectral Furor' is a formula which, by upsetting the very nature
of the space the victim inhabits causes neural as well as brute
physical damage.
 
With 'Hand of Chaos,' Thanatos perfected this line of magic, and he
returned to his researches on the art of astral travel.

and nature. All know as well that once you enter the multiverse, you
may never return through the Spectral Gate.

1 1278882046 STORY-1~
&cLong ago, magic was plentiful within the world, and the different nations 
prospered. The first tolling of the death of an era rang throughout history 
when a young magician, known to his few acquaintances as Tanzean'al, was 
corrupted by his greed and lust for power. Tanzean'al was seduced by the 
tempting, treacherous whispers of a succubus, a demon temptress who found 
in Tanzean'al a perfect vessel of destruction. Unholy knowledge wormed its 
way into his ears, and Tanzean'al practiced magic not meant to be known by 
mortal minds.

One night, in a fit of inhuman rage, Tanzean'al slew his teachers, wielding 
his newfound powers - to great, terrible effect. Nobody present survived his 
demonic rampage - his only remaining teacher alive through sheer, 
coincidental absence. Kolak, the royal magician of Paleon City's court, had 
been away, visiting another nation in a diplomatic role. When word of the 
slaughter reached King James, monarch of Paleon, he ordered the immediate 
capture of the magicidal wizard. His company of soldiers rushed out, but were 
beset by abominations - hideous races, twisted by Tanzean'al's magic from 
captured elves and dwarves into darker, more sinister humanoids. The onslaught 
of the new races - orcs, goblins, ogres and trolls - quickly routed the 
frightened soldiers, eating most of those who did not flee. Tanzean'al ordered 
the soldiers' skulls placed on pikes to decorate the front of his fortified 
manor. Thus, the overwhelming victor of this skirmish, Tanzean'al began his 
campaign of terror - capturing and warping the small villages in the countryside, 
gaining new members for his army. This army - this THRONG - mutilated all that 
stood before it, and its terrible reputation spread.
~

1 1278882251 STORY-2~
&WChapter 2 : The Alliance

&cMeanwhile, King James had just received news of his soldiers' demise, and 
Tanzean'al's swelling Throng. He met with his General, and they came to the 
conclusion that Tanzean'al was danger that would require all of their 
attention and resources. The Royal Magician Kolak, more knowledgeable in 
these affairs, warned King James that one nation would not be enough - 
Tanzean'al wielded the powers of Hell itself. Thus was formed the ALLIANCE, 
the banding together of all the free races to oppose Tanzean'al's Throng.
  
On the Magician's advice, King James contacted all the nations of the free 
races - Elves, Dwarves, Humans and Gnomes - and urged them to join the 
Alliance. Heeding his words, and the threat of Tanzean'al's Throng, they 
assented, and together, the Alliance prepared to do battle with the Throng.

The two armies met before the Dwarven city Manaoke. The Throng, fuelled by 
Tanzean'al's fel energies, had the upper hand - things looked grim for the 
freedom of the realm. Then, an unexpected boon; Six celestial Dragons 
descended from the heavens, and joined battle with the Throng. Tanzean'al, 
outraged at the tipping of the scales in the Alliance's favor, slew the 
Green Dragon with an eldritch bolt of unholy power.

The unparalleled carnage of the battle, coupled with the death of one of 
the six Dragons, drew the attention of an omniscient, omnipotent being - 
the CREATOR.

&WChapter 3 : The Creator
&c
The CREATOR, who had given magic to the world to be used to make the lives 
of people easier, was furious at the abominations he saw created with it. 
The Creator appeared in the battlefield, and with a swoop of his hand he 
gathered all the magic in the world. The Creator declared with a booming 
voice so that all could hear, "Since thee hast defiled the magic I gave 
thee, I now take it back.." The Creator looked at the sneering face of 
Tanzean'al and his demon seductress and he saidn "Thy greed imprisons 
thee. Stay with your minions forever in Hell!". With that, Tanzean'al and 
his minions were imprisoned in the bowels of Hell. The Creator then 
scattered the magic he gathered across the world, so it must be sought 
out.

&WChapter 4: Free again
&c
For centuries, Tanzean'al has been imprisoned in his part of the world. 
But locking true evil away is impossible, and there are always those that 
believe the promises of might and power. And thus agents of Tanzean'al 
were recruited to search the world and to battle the Alliance so they can 
gain enough of the magic back to free Tanzean'al once again. It was a 
restless time coming and many battles occured. Sneak attacks from Throng 
members took the lives of those allied. 

Tanzean'al has been freed from his imprisonment, and again is raising an 
army unlike the world has ever known. The Throng are coming to the borders 
of the free nations who once again have called out to form a strong 
alliance, so they can be ready for the vicious attacks to come.

1 1122239142 STR STRENGTH~
Strength (STR in your 'score') represents your character's physical power.
 
The most common concern with strength deals with how much your character
can carry.  For each additional point of strength  you gain an additional
amount of maximum carryable weight.  Any character with 20 strength can
carry 500kgs; Warriors and Rangers can have a maximum of 25 strength, and
can therefore carry up to 999kgs when their strength is at its maximum.
 
Strength also affects (among other things):
 
 - damage roll and hitroll; for each additional point of strength, each
   of these will increase
 
 - chances of success for bash, stun, bashdoor, shove and drag, and the
   ability to dual-wield heavier weapons
 
Strength is the prime attribute of warriors, rangers and paladins.

With the incantation 'Sulfurous Spray,' the casting mage culls from
the air the elements necessary to form a strong acid which rains
down upon his opponent or opponents.  This strength and velocity

of armor and clothing, and it is also able to harm opponents one
might think resistant to such attacks, due to its magical nature.

1 1216384780 'SUMMON LIGHT'~
Syntax: cast 'summon light'

One of the first clerical spells remembered, 'summon light' is never- 
the-less quite complicated. When it is cast a thin equilateral cross will 
appear before the caster, at about 4-5' from the ground. Over a few 
seconds the cross will gradually substantiate and emit arcane light which 
will illuminate even the darkest of dark areas, yet do no damage to anyone 
looking directly at it. The cross is fairly large (one 'leg' is about the 
size of two adult fists together) and immobile - it will simply 'float' in 
the middle of the room until the spell wears off.

Syntax:  cast summon <character>

This spell summons a character from anywhere in the world to your own
location, and stuns you. Here's the deal:

- Victim has to be IN the world somewhere.
- Victim cannot be in a SAFE, PRIVATE, SOLITARY, NOSUMMON or NORECALL room.
- Victim cannot be AGGRESSIVE or PROTOTYPE (mobs), or flagged NOSUMMON.
- Summoner cannot be in a NOASTRAL or NOSUMMON room.
- Victim cannot be more than 3 levels higher than the summoner.
- Victim cannot be fighting.
- Deadly players can not be summoned.

With that said, if you're casting it and the victim feels a 'strange pulling
sensation' then you're on the right track.

of the deity, 'object', which summons an object of the deity and 'recall',
which sends the player back to his recall point (bypassing norecall flag).
 
Note: All deities offer corpse and recall, while object and avatar are for
particular deities only.

103 1207478848 SVN~
svn checkout/co 
svn checkout or svn co. This command is used to pull an SVN tree such as svn://linuxfromscratch.org/BLFS/trunk/BOOK 
(the BLFS Development book) from the server. You should only need to do this once. 

svn add 
svn add. When you are creating a new file or directory, you need to tell the SVN server about it. This command does 
that. Note that the file won't appear in the repository until you do an svn commit (see below). 

svn propset 
svn propset. When you are creating a new file or directory, you generally need to tell the SVN to apply properties to 
the file in places that have keywords in a special format such as $Date: 2007-04-03 14:28:17 -0500 (Tue, 03 Apr 2007) 

svn delete 
svn delete. This does what it says! When you do an svn commit the file will be deleted from your local sand box 
immediately as well as from the repository after committing. 

svn status 
svn status. This command prints the status of working directories and files. 

svn update/up 
svn update or svn up. This command syncs your local sand box with the server. If you have made local changes, it will 
try and merge any changes on the server with your changes on your machine. 

svn commit/ci 
svn commit or svn ci. This command recursively sends your changes to the SVN server.
svn ci -m <message>

svn diff 
svn diff. This is useful for two different purposes. First, those without write access to the BLFS SVN server can use 
it to generate patches to send to the BLFS-Dev mailing list. To do this, simply edit the files in your local sand box 
then run svn diff > FILE.patch from the root of your BLFS directory. You can then attach this file to a message to 
the BLFS-Dev mailing list where someone with editing rights can pick it up and apply it to the book. The second use 
is to find out what has changed between two revisions using: svn diff -r revision1:revision2 FILENAME. For example: 
svn diff -r 168:169 index.xml will output a diff showing the changes between revisions 168 and 169 of index.xml. 

svn move 
svn move SRC DEST or svn mv SRC DEST or svn rename SRC DEST or svn ren SRC DEST. This command moves a file from one 
directory to another or renames a file. The file will be moved on your local sand box immediately as well as on the 
repository after committing.

1 1253919788 SWIM~
&cSelf-explanatory - the swim skill is a latent ability that represents
your ability to stay above and move under water.

Once you've been taught the skill, simply move into the water to begin
swimming. Note: This has been made very realistic. Swimming will use up
your movement points, and at low percentages, FAST. When you can no longer
keep your head above water, you will start to drown, and may even sink
under.

A good way to practice this skill is to find shallow water close to shore
so if you find yourself drowning you can quickly jump out.

Be aware that even though your movement points will go down consistently,
you may not necessarily see a 'swim message', so keep a careful eye lest
you find yourself underwater.

Swim will also affect how fast you can move about underwater.

0 1122239142 TANZEAN'AL~
.  The Mad Mage, Tanzean'al, was at one time the most powerful and 
respected mystic in the world. But Tanzean'al was not content with 
the limited potential of a mortal form. He raged against the 
Creator for making him, the most powerful mage in the world, lesser 
than Itself. The Mad Mage used his gifts to gather an army to 
overthrow the Powers That Be and make Tanzean'al the sole ruler of 
the realms.
 
   Powerful as he was however, he was no match for the Creator. It 
took the petulant sorcerer and gave him the immortal status he 
craved, but confined within a hellish prison of fire and pain. To 
prevent further abuses of Its gift, the Creator scattered the 
secrets of magic throughout the world, so that only people 
possessing patience and wisdom would ever become as powerful as the 
fallen Tanzean'al.
 
   Unfortunately it did not end there. From his torment in Hell 
Tanzean'al developed his powers and used them to mutate and pervert 
thousands of innocents, creating whole races of evil aberrations, 
the orcs and goblins, to ravage the lands. Though at first driven 
back to their unholy pits, it was not long before the Mad Mage's 
powers became strong enough to break free of hell, and the tide 
turned against the world of the Creator. He conquered several 
countries, and the remaining free nations of the world have issued 
a call to arms for all to combat the army of darkness.
 
   As it stands right now, Tanzean'al is the root of nearly all 
conflict, suffering, and inequity in the realms. His avarice for 
power and jealousy of the Creator itself have sparked the entire 
world into throes of self-destruction.

will have a &P[&RTEACHER&P]&c rank assigned to them. Using the teacher 
command you can find out what spells/skills that teacher teaches. The 
teacher will only tell you the spells or skills that you may learn from 
him. The teacher may teach more things, but only to certain class 
characters. As you gain in levels check the teacher again, because 
he/she may unlock another skill/spell that they may now teach you. 

Homeland teachers will teach almost all spells/skills you can learn that 
are level 20 and under. Other teachers will teach a maximum of 20 spells 
and 20 skills.  This refers to single class characters.  Keep in mind that
multi-class characters' skills/spells will increase this number to include
skills/spells not covered by other classes.  

&CNote:&c
If the spell/skill is a low level spell/skill for another class, but over 
level 20 for you the homeland teachers might not teach it, instead any 
teacher outside homelands will.However, it won't be listed.

&CWarning &cDo not give out teacher information over public channels. 
Tells are okay, if the player gives up, and just wants help.  Also,
teachers will teach more skills/spells as you grow in level.  They only
show what you yourself can learn at that moment.  So you do have to go

&Y6D Game Event Templates &C

* Note these are only guidelines, and event particulars do not have to be
  copied and pasted, if you want to add some extra scenarios, etc. 

This goes without saying, but It maybe necessary to have one of your alts, 
or another staff member alts participate in the event so more then one player 
is in the event. 

Should that be the case, of course do not allow the staff member alt to win, 
they are only there for group involvement. The only exception would be a 
staff member that is playing his alt for an arena battle, or freeze tag. 

First step to running a game event is to let players know in advance we are 
having an event. Post the date and time for a game event on the forums, and 
gboard. (For example Friday Eastern Standard Time 10pm, we will be having a 
Drunken Merchant Event. Saturday Eastern Standard Time at 0600am we will be 
having an arena championship event. 

That doesn't mean you can not run it on the spur of the moment if players are
online.  Do it, players love it.

Gah, I know things come in life, and it's not easy to commit your time for 
scheduling events, but the more you can prearrange and post these things, 
the more likely players will start showing up and coming on for your events. 

Second step, ooc Game Event will be starting in 10 minutes anyone interesting 
in participating please send me a tell, the channel we will use for the game 
event is the event channel. Now you can start your event and let them know 
that everyone who will be participating will recieve 25 gold each, or whatever
the event allows.  More challenging event = a little better reward.

-1 1252017016 THIEF THIEVES~
&cThe thief is a dark character which makes use of many skills often deemed
improper by the rest of society. Known to haunt the darkest roads and
peeking into others' inventories, picking locks, or attacking from behind
with deadly back stabs. With amazing dexterity they have the ability to
circle around an enemy, but for living such a dark life, thieves have
always had a bad reputation so don't be surprised if you are always under
suspicion. Thieves start off fairly weak, but as they gain skills such as
back stab and circle they soon become dangerous foes.  A thief is always
useful when there is  a lock that needs picked, or an item that one wishes
to acquire without detection.

As a thief you will often have to walk the dodgy path that others avoid.

Thieves are physically average, yet weak in magic.

A Thief focuses primarily on &WSTRENGTH&c.

Thieves come from the following races - &WHUMAN, HALFLING, OGRE, ORC, TROLL, 
SHADE, GOBLIN, DROW&c.

10 1237073833 THRONG~
&RI. The Clan History: 

The Throng is the Army of Evil and Chaos, brought forth to wreak havoc in 
the world. The Throng value strength of arms and deceit above all else. 
Joining the Throng is a lifetime commitment, as the Throng will track any 
deserters down and show no mercy usually ending in a very gruesome death 
after months of torture. Their goal is world Domination, Every creature 
will bow down to them or will burn in the ashes they leave behind.

II. The Clan Purpose: 

The purpose of the Throng is to destroy the Alliance and put the free races 
in chains. Taking what is rightfully ours, buy force of arms or through 
political deceit. The throng will only help their own. But help comes at a 
price. after all, we are the evil ones. 

III. Role Play in the Throng: 

Throng role play can be extremely varied. All Throng members must be deadly, 
as this furthers our goals on fighting the alliance. 

Role play is rather open ended, allowing players almost free reign with their 
characters and their actions, as long as it benefits the clan and does not 
show weakness. A few examples would be political intrigue allowing the 
gathering of resources or additional members. 
No matter what the views portrayed by the RP of the character is, they are 
expected to have absolute loyalty to the clan, and to the decisions made by 
leadership. All voices and opinions will be heard. Role play is highly 
encouraged within the clan.
The Code of Honor and Conduct: 

We are evil, you expect to have a code of Conduct? Honor is a personal choice, 
but don't expect other clan members to react kindly or for Alliance to believe 
you have any. Now get back onto the battlefield and start killing! 

If you think you are cut out for this clan, contact a member to be referred to 
the Chieftain or War Master, or talk to them directly. It should be great fun!

0 1122239142 TICK~
Many of the actions in the Realms are based upon interval timers, including
combat, most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell
duration, weather, and area resetting.
 
Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks in these Realms average 60 seconds of real time, but the
actual amount varies randomly from 45 seconds to 75 seconds.
 
Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if there are no characters in
in the area; less often (15 minutes) if any characters are present; Also,
some lower level areas have shorter reset periods, while some higher level
areas have longer reset periods.
 
Note that objects lying on the ground will not be regenerated if anyone is
in the area when it resets.
 
Area resets are indicated by 'squeaking noises' or other messages just prior
to the reset itself.

depending on if what they train is a spell or a skill.  The trainee looses
all hitpoints from the battering of getting a new skill taught to you the hard

Once you have reached 100% in your triple experience bar (seen
by typing 'level' or 'score') you can active triple experience for
exactly one hour, meaning any experience gained during that hour is
tripled for you (doesn't stack with global dexp).

Your triple experience timer will save over copyovers and when quitting,
but keep in mind you have an hour REAL TIME of triple experience - even
when you quit, your timer will keep ticking away.

In addition, when your texp bar reaches 100%, you can continue to gain
by solving the questions - but you will gain much less % per solve. For
example, from 0 - 100% you'll gain 10% for each solve. 100 - 200% you'll
gain 8%. 200 - 500% you'll gain 5%. 500 - 1000% you'll gain 2%. If you
make it over 1000% texp, you'll gain only 1% for each successful solve.
Staff members may also choose to set a 'global dexp' for the mud, meaning
it will affect all players for one hour. This also comes into affect

are still powerful enough to kill those too low. I would suggest being
at least level 10 or higher before you go in. There is some decent 
equipment in here along with creatures for those that would want
to seek them out. It is Recommended that you bring a light.

Arakus, a renowned priest, always looked in awe at his friend's ability of

So he studied hard and long, and came up with an alternative. He came up 
with an incantation that can be aimed at any target on the globe and if 
the caster's mind is in balance and focussed, then the being hit with this spell, 
will regain a little bit of their health.&D

-1 1252019143 VAMPIRE VAMPIRES~
&cVampires are one of the powerful creatures of the Realms.  Being a creature
of the undead, they require copious quantities of fresh blood.  Instead of
using mana, Vampires use blood points (BP) for spell casting.  If a Vampire
takes a large amount of damage, Blood points will be lost, but, Blood points
can give a small surge of hit points (HP) in battle when needed.  As an undead
creature of the night, Vampires receive an armor class (AC) bonus at night,
and access to their more powerful skills like 'mistwalk'.

Vampires are based off the theme 'The Vampire Chronicles' by Anne Rice.

Base stats for vampire before are the below, what class you chose will also
adjust your stats.

Watch will work 24 hours a day from the time you put a watch on a player until

We need you to be real careful about the size of your watch file. If you
are watching a number of players or sites, please do not just forget about
your watches and allow your watch file to grow to outrageous sizes. You
should never have more than 5,000 or 10,000 lines in your watch file.
If you are doing some watching, be sure you check your watch file daily
and either print it, display it, copy it to your hard drive or do whatever
you need to do with it but then ... please ... please ... be sure you
clear it so that it don't grow huge and eat up all our hard drive space.
If you clear your watch file daily ... there should be no problem. If you
aren't watching anyone ... you don't have to worry about this. But if you
start a watch, it is your responsibility to know how big your watch file
is and to stop the watch when you no longer need it. The command
&Cwatch size &ctells you how many lines are in your watch file.
The command &Cwatch clear&c clears (deletes) your watch file.
For the time being the maximum number of lines you can display at one time
is 2000. So ... even if you have 5,000 lines in your watch file ... you can
only display 1,000 at a time.

&cThere are several different kinds of rooms here:
Water rooms that you can swim in, water rooms that you can't swim in
(require flying or a boat), underwater rooms and the ocean floor.

Going underwater will require you to either have the &WAQUA BREATH &cspell
or hold your breath for a certain amount of time. Swimming is a latent
ability that will let you swim faster underwater, as well as stay on the
surface without sinking and drowning.

Objects can also sink and fall underwater, until they reach the ocean floor.
This depends on the weight of the object. If you find a corpse or favorite
weapon has gone missing while swimming, there's a good chance you'll find it at
the bottom of the ocean.

&cWhy do we have Wilderness?
&W-----------------------
&cWe want to create a true sense of distance.  There are literally thousands 
of rooms on the wilderness map. Creating that many rooms would take the building
staff years.  That being said if and when we do have areas that can be used to
replace different parts of wilderness we shall.

With wilderness, we can have a huge world, and it does not mean that we will stop 
development of normal areas.  What it does mean is that we won't spend time making 
big empty areas like the roads, oceans, and forests of the world.

&W----------------------
&cThe wilderness map is thousands of rooms all densely connected.  That means that
every room has a connection to the north, east, south, and west. Some directions 
maybe blocked at times by different terrain features.

You have several options available for how the wilderness is displayed to you.  You
can adjust the display with the &CWILDERNESS &ccommand.

WILD MOBS

Are Random Mob Encounters that you will get when your travelling the wilderness.
They spawn at a level that is close to your own.  They are aggressive, and will try
to cause you harm.  The roads will not have wild mob spawns.  Stay on the roads, and
you will not have any an encounter.  Do not bot these mobs to level.  The wild mobs
are a nice addition here, if it becomes a problem, they maybe removed.  Wild mobs
will follow you onto roads if you encounter them elsewhere.  Wild mobs give quite a 
bit &CLESS&c experience then area mobs.

All homelands have a shop that sells the following items: 
1) Jar of odor enhancing powder   - &CIncreases&c chance of wild mob encounters.
2) Jar of odor neutralizer powder - &CDecreases&c chance of wild mob encounters.

101 1254881203 WIZINVIS~
&cAll immortals have the responsibility to be available to others whenever
possible, be they mortal or immortal.  When the use of wizinvis is called
for, the following are parameters for its use:

 - Immortals level 101 through 102 should be visible at all times, save
   for when snooping, running a quest or some similar circumstance.

 - Immortals level 103 and up may invis to any level at their discretion.

Guidelines for use of wizinvis by 103 and higher:
It is considered mandatory to be visible to all other immortals whenever
reasonably able to do so.  Using wizinvis beyond 101 to facilitate work on
a project, allow concentration on something, avoid excessive tells or the
like is fine, but it should only be used while necessary.

Guidelines for use of wizinvis beyond 101 in immortal channels:
Sightings of Someone's in immortal channels should be kept to a minimum.
If you are free enough to be able to use an immortal channel, you should
be visible to the lowest immortal in that channel; no higher than 103 in
Muse, no higher than 101 in immtalk, etc.  Being a Someone to anyone on
an immortal channel should only occur if you're too tied up to go
visible but need to make a comment.

The same applies to all situations using channels, tells or actions.
Avoid being a Someone to mortals and immortals alike unless you have
a good reason to do otherwise.

Tanzan'eal is working on his army again.

He is focussed at present on creating new strong races, made up from 
different other races. These abominations are not finalized yet. They 
appear to be very uncoordinated and the whole being is not working 
together yet as they should, but rather they operate as the individuals 
they once were. 

Time has passed and a first set of hideous monsters has been created and 
polished. Soon they'll be ready to be sent out as a trial attack onto the 
city of Paleon, where the war of shadows has been forgotten ... 

Will the abomination stand this simple test? Will Tanzan'eal be this lucky 
with his first set of experimentations?

--------------------------------------
This abomination exists of different species sewn together. 
The abomination will fight well, coordinated as one.

Once it is killed, or right before it will get killed, it will splat and 
all the creatures that were one, will now need to be fought. These 
individual creatures will be easier than the big creature initially. 

-----------------------
Perhaps a shady figure will be seen in town, revealing some information of 
this planned attack on Paleon for a sum of money, or an artifact. The word 
throng shall be whispered and so does the name Tanzan'eal. 

REQUIREMENTS : Everyone plays a role, as the character they are 
representing. All says have to be in character. Throng of course will not 
fight this abomination but rather try to avoid the abomination to be 
slain, while alliance will of course be summoned and warned from this 
arrival.

Fishing Tournament!

Rules
1. Have a baited fishing rod in your inventory at all times.
2. Once you are finished fishing, return to The Dock.
3. Find your own fish, (killstealing is not allowed).
4. Standard quest rules apply.
---------------------------------------------------------------
Start : 1 baited fishing rod and 1 filetting knife

During game : fishing rods might break (into broken reed and a metal 
hook), then a new one will need assembled from items found (dig for worms, 
connect them to the hook, fetch good quality reed and connect that to the 
baited hook to get a new baited fishing rod) 

After a kill, the fisher brings forth his filetting knife and cuts a nice 
filet out of the fish OR he keeps the whole fish. But carrying filets 
around is a tad easier. Some fish might carry a surprise in their stomach. 

After the tournament :
All fishing gear needs given back (rod, hook (baited and non baited), 
worms) as well as the filets and extra items the fish might have had. 
These extra items will give bonus points. Also those that were not 
succesful in the battle with the fish, will get a little something for 
trying. 

Since the area consists of merely 30 rooms, best to bring in up to 4 
fishers (selection of those through an earlier quest) 
fishpond.are   | Rooms: 10320 - 10350
This quest is for near avs to avs. (L70 and up?)

Quest consisting of several parts ... 

1) Room find based on tips and hints + item find 
For eg Manure everywhere, wish I had a shovel to scoop it on a pile (so 
locate room with manure in it and bring a shovel) 

Per room, the first one is brought to a room where they can't communicate 
with others while the rest of the people get a chance to earn their spot 
in the second part of the quest. This is done using the same tactic (room 
& item find) 

You tell them you wish to thank them and give them a reward, but like it 
goes nowadays, one has to work for their reward. They can choose the way 
of earning it : 
This will be said once the set number of peoples (min 4) has been chosen

Have them choose, most votes win
1) mob kill
2) seek and destroy
3) item find

Option 1 : mob kill ... tell em they have to go, as is (don't let them 
spell up while they're waiting, so no magic room), and trans them to the 
arena, invoke a tough mob there, and let them have it 

Option 2 : seek and destroy ... trans into a different area where a mob is 
set loose, they can prep if they like, and hunt it down 

Option 3 : either existing item or made item for the purpose, give hints, 
top 2 to come back with it, get top reward, others handful of glory for 
trying 

Option 1 and 2 can be won by being one of the two people last standing.
Achieving this can be by 1) flee like the whimp you are, 2) work together 
and kill 3) hide around till the excess of folks die
