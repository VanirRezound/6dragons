The Builder Commandments
------------------------
Written by Rene, updated 8/14/2010


1. USE SPELL CHECK AND PROOFREAD FOR GRAMMAR.

2. Do not use 'YOU' in room description. You, as a builder, do not know the character is walking, sitting, etc. You do not know if they are 'intimidated' or 'claustrophobic'. Go ahead and say 'an eerie, cramped tunnel' but don't say stuff like 'it makes you feel ___'. You can't control a player's emotions or actions. DON'T DO IT.

3. Don't describe mobs or objects that are actually 'tangible'! As a rule, if the player can see a mob or object already when then LOOK, don't describe it in the room. First off, they already see it, you're repeating yourself. Secondly, if that mob is killed, the room description would look silly.

4. Do not use multiple colors without specific permission. It HURTS to read a paragraph written in green, magenta, cyan, and blood red. Spare us.

Keep reading. Use 'Buildp2'.
~
E
buildp2~
For area creators-

5. When you make a room, you must write a description. Likewise, if you make an object or a mob, you MUST include an extra description. You really can't think of anything? Ask a friend, ask another builder, ask me. I don't want players looking at something and not seeing anything.

6. Be very very careful that progs don't loop. Our last loop made the game go down for a week. 


-more stuff to be added-


Break the rules once, I will warn you. Break them repeatedly, I will boot you off the team. Please, be a team player.


Keep reading. Use 'buildref' to see a list of important references.

Room 1200 is the Fortress of Operations. We chill here.
Room 4500 mentions building rules. Go NORTH to find a retired staff member who will tell you the basics for each staff section (PR, Architects, Events, Code). 
Room 36150 is my office if you need to find me while I'm afk.

http://6dragons.org/guide.html  is the site with the building guide.
http://alternis6d.forumotion.com/  is the unofficial forum. Useful place to find out if the game is down, or to leave messages and questions, etc. To join as staff, sign up then let me know in game what your username was so I can approve you and set you up to view the staff section. Useful building docs will also be posted here.

6D PR staff manual~
&dThe &6 Dragons&W PR Staff Manual&d

This Manual was designed to aid the Player Relations
Administrator of 6D concerning rules, policy, assignments,
ideas and other such topics that pertain to the PR Wizard.

  --&YMaynard&D.

For those who wish to peruse my depths, simply type

preface~
&dThe &Y6D&W PR Staff Manual&d Preface&d

Welcome Aboard!
You're now a 6D Player Relations Wiz. In this position, you will be 
assisting players, encouraging roleplay, enforcing rules, and focusing 
on any number of tasks. Also, until you meet the requirements listed below, 
you will be flagged as TEMPORARY (similar to Seeker), and upon completion 
of such you are awarded a rank in the Staff (sometimes depending on your 
focus), an Office and other things as given by the Head of PR. 
As a Staff member, you should read up on all GBoard notices, announcements 
and gnotes, especially on the Staff GBoard (7) -- particularly gnote 21 by 
Maynard, titled **PR** -- This gnote further lists assignments (Tasks) that 
may be undertaken and/or given. Also, it is good to know what is listed 
under HELP RULES, HELP PKILL RULES, HELP CORPSE RETRIEVAL and WIZHELP, as 
all of these have information both useful and necessary. In addition to 
these, you may reference the Book of Game Rules (object 139), given to all 
new characters, and other works.

ASSIGNMENTS

As a PR Wiz, you will be given Assignments to complete, and may be asked 
to choose a focus - to be a Jack Of All Trades and a Master of One.  If 
assignments are not given any deadlines by the Head, then assume that 
they should be completed ASAP until further notice, in order to keep things 
running efficiently. 

These pages will go further into individual topics:

RP Encouragement  ............. Page4
         Contests  ............ Page5
Player Help  .................. Page6
Quests  ....................... Page7
Helpfiles/Socials  ............ Page8
Rules Enforcement  ............ Page9

**All Assignments as listed above should be completed as they pertain to 
each PR Staff member.**
~
E
page4~
RP ENCOURAGEMENT

RP ENCOURAGEMENT is an Assignment that is shared by everyone, and can be 
done in many ways, including the Reward-system (RPContests, rewarding 
those who RP, etc), immersion (using the SWITCH command to start or 
enter roleplay with PCs), or any others thought of. 

**PR Staff should have Encouraged Role-play as stated above and have it 
logged/witnessed at least twice.**

To turn the page type "look page5".
~
E
page5~
CONTESTS

RPContests, Story Contests, and any and all other Contests or reward-
systems used for RP Encouragement should be handled decently and fairly, 
with proper rewards that are pre-approved by Vladaar or Maynard.  Also, 
color is a tool that can be useful to highlight particular facets of your 
Contest, but be wary of blinding your contestants!

PLAYER HELP

PLAYER HELP is a mandatory Assignment that EVERYONE should be proficient 
in, whether it's Q&A, newbie help, or (technical or not) problems of any 
sort -- and this should always be handled according to PR Policy 
(friendliness and courtesy as stated above). 

**PR Staff should have handled at least three logged/witnessed situations 
where he/she was needed and legitimately helped a player.**

To turn the page type "look page7".
~

QUESTS

QUESTING, an individual area of focus, may be done with mobs, objects and/or
rooms with or without programs attached to either (the programmed being 
named as a "progged Quest", available to players even if no Staff are
online), using the SWITCH command with mobs, using ECHO, INVADE, or any
wizcommands that are available to the PR Staff member. Use discretion 
concerning rewards, and have permission per Quest and per reward given first
from the Head. Also, building and coding are recognized as focuses, and
should be reviewed with the Head of PR and the Head of Area Architects.

**PR Staff with a Focus should have at least TWO works reviewed, 
satisfactorily completed and implemented, or at least THREE satisfactory 
and witnessed Quests done (Questing Focus).**

HELPFILES/SOCIALS

HELPFILES and SOCIALS are both important parts of the game - Players and 
Staff require helpfiles to assist with their gameplay/work, and socials 
give a comfortable touch to the game that can be very entertaining or 
useful if done correctly.

Commands to use:
*HELPCHECK (Checks list of helpfiles requiring completion)
*HEDIT (Opens buffer for creating/editing hfile)
*HSET (Sets the hfile level, keyword, saves hfile)
*SEDIT (Creates, edits, deletes, saves social)

**PR Staff with a Focus should have at least TWO works reviewed,
satisfactorily completed and implemented.**

RULES

ALL Staff are to abide by every and any rule listed in HELP RULES, HELP
PKILL LAWS, and any other rules as listed on the General (1), Announce (3), 
and/or Staff (7) Gboards by any Head, Co-Head or Asst. Head of Council 
(from now on all implied when referring to "Head"); and any rules given by 
Heads at any point after.  This includes NO CHEATING, for your own 
characters or for any others. Keep in mind that most wizcommands are 
logged, and that the Rules are in place for the greater gameplay for 
everyone collectively so we don't have any messes.
 
It is now Staff Policy however, to not only have regular PC characters, 
but to have them on whenever one does log onto their imm - this being in 
place to support growth of playerbase, to keep ears open on all GChannels, 
and to have a player available to help another if no others are around.

**PR Staff should know Rules and be able to enforce them.**

RULES ENFORCEMENT

Remember when you deal with players to always use PR Policy, whether it is 
a comfortable situation or a heated one. Set the example, and try from 
there. However, if the need should arise with problem Players, then know 
how to deal with the circumstances. 
Here is the list of how to work with it:
1. Calmly discuss problem with player, alert them to their breach of Rules.
2. Warn the player, that they will be punished if they do not desist. 
May add Nuisance flags if wanted.
3. If persistant, then use SILENCE/NOEMOTE/NOTITLE and also SCATTER as 
appropriate - you may use NOTELL, however try not to as it becomes only 
form of communication short of in-person.
4. If more persistant, use FREEZE, SLAY, NOTELL/STRIP/STREW as needed 
(as possible) - if real bad case, use HELL.
5. Last Resort - ask Head to BAN the Player, if not available then FQUIT 
player and write GNote to Head explaining situation.
If you have any problem or question, then ask a Council Head.

**PR Staff should be able to roleplay such a Situation and then use an 
Enforcement command with the Head of PR/Asst. Head of PR, if such a 
situation has not already occurred and been logged/witnessed.**

IDEAS

For whatever assignment you are working on, be creative and have fun!  If 
it is a progged Quest, think of exactly what you want to accomplish, with 
all the zest and gusto, then plan out how you will need to program it to 
accomplish your goal. Use ifchecks, MPCommands, THE WORKS!  If you are 
encouraging RP, then perhaps you could hold a "Festival", a lottery or an 
Auction - mobs can almost *never* be TOO MUCH if done correctly!  Keep 
everything fun, and YOU will have fun just as much as the players will.  

Think of what the players would find challenging, UNBORING, and very fun 
(even if hard), and then find every way to make it full of life, utilizing 
all you can muster to deliver the mood, atmosphere, and realism to the
player.

*More information can be found at the 6d website, http://6dragons.org 

**PR Staff must complete all Requirements- of Rules, PR Policy, Assignments,
and an Interview with the Head of Council in order to have the TEMPORARY 
flag removed and to be initiated a complete 6D PR STAFF.**

Have fun, and good luck!
~
E
page2~
PR POLICY means that we are courteous at all times, decent, not ever
offensive, even in heated circumstances with players or other Staff members
- PR Staff is a body with respect and integrity, so show that and do not
stoop to the level of an immature player with an attitude. Also, any
differences within the Staff should be handled decently, and NOT 
over GChannels or discussed with players like grade school gossip.
 
PR POLICY also means friendly interaction with players; because of 
the stage 6D is in, we are looking to attract players, not to show
them a dull MUD with an unfriendly STAFF.  This means greeting all
players when you log on/off.  Also congratulating players that level.
Do not merely log and chit chat with other staff, or play like your
a god.  You are staff for 6D and need to act like a professional at
all times.  
 
**PR Staff should be able to demonstrate proper PR Policy.**

can be accessed by any players, even non-clan members.

&CAn Advanced Setup

Ahh, looks like we got some big spenders, and crafty leaders here.

This is the same as a basic setup, except all 30 rooms are utilized.

It can be done to make some type of maze for those entering the clan
so non-members have a hard time finding their way inside.

Paintings, signs, and other objects can be noted in room descriptions
that read the clans motto, creed, and maybe even founders.

This is done by redit ed sign or whatever you want for a player to
look at.

&CClan Rules

Leaders and clan members shall be patient while waiting for clans to
be built or improved.  If a STAFF member tells you it is being handled
and not to ask about it again, doing so may forfeit your clan.  This
is basically saying do not pester STAFF about when your clan will be
done.  It will be done as soon as we are able.

Disputes between clan leaders on objects, pricing, etc shall be handled
via a council between the parties involved.  The decision of STAFF is
final.

Clan Leaders will are allowed one alt in their clan.
All other members must be other players.
Each clan may have a maximum of 10 members.
There will be a maximum of 5 clans.

&CCosts to the Player
 
First off players that want a clan must &RAPPLY&C for the clan.
Its not automatic because they saved up the gold needed.
 
By applying I mean, they need to complete a detailed clan theme,
and name to submit to us.  This will be reviewed for quality, and
used in creating the clan.  Players should be told in a timely
manner whether their application is good, or needs works, and what
needs work done to it. 
 
A Basic Clan Package consists of-
25 room vnums
1 room must be a store room, with clanstore flag.
 
Your basic clan package with no bells and whistles currently is set
at the cost of 5 million gold.  This may change as the economy here
changes.
 
 
* NOTE: All clan entrances can only be hidden, and locked.

the walls.  A swirling portal of energy is part of the north wall, and leads
into a dark dimension of unknown places.  A library is to the south.

A Sandy Path~
This path is somewhat narrow, and is lined with a long garden filled with red
and white roses. It leads to the east. The roses are to high to climb over or
walk through. A slight breeze passes through here and cools the area. The path
has small pockets of flowers growing in it as well. Not too far to the east
lies a large building, its' walls made of a black marble with white lines
swirling throughout it. To the west, a portal has been opened and leads to the
6D Staff area.

Nagafen's Tower: Level 1~
The inside of the tower here is vast. It seems to be an inside garden of sorts.
The main attraction is a single rose bush, in the center of the room, that
stands in its' own flowerbed. Its' petals aer not red, or white like the all
of the others surrounding it in other flowerbeds, but a black color, with white
edges to the petals. It puts off a very sweet smell. A small stream can be seen
running through eventually leading to a small rock pond and waterfall. A few
bonzai plants have grown to the rocks and seem to be doing quite well. Behind
all these flowerbeds and gardens a single spiral staircase lies. A sign next
to it reads, "Nagafen's Office".

Nagafen's Office~
The walls here are made of black marble with white streak running through them.
On the walls, a picture of a rose has been etched into the wall and is very
detailed. A small garden lies in the back of the room by the staircase. There
is a white marble desk and coffee table here, with a few chairs to rest in.
The staircase leads up, but seems to be sealed of by a door of some kind.

Sinjin's Roadside Cafe~
This cosy room is cleverly separated into both kitchen and dining area. 
The entire expanse of wall is covered in neat cherry wood panels and a 
number of paintings of landscapes and some attractive nudes. Mysterious 
black granite flooring paves the way through the room guiding you to two 
steps down into the kitchen area. The kitchen has all the appliances 
including stove and refrigerator tucked in between neat rows of solid 
cherry wood cupboards and counter tops as well as the prominence of coffee 
making facilities. Aside from the raised floor, two rows of potted plants 
at different heights line the edge of the platform to create a barrier, 
invisible glass podiums supporting the colorful display which look as if 
they freely levitate. A large cherry wood table decorated with fresh 
flowers and candles invites you to dine in luxury, supported by matching 
leather upholstered chairs whose curves invite you to enter their embrace. 
Subdued lighting from the candles and decorative silver gas lamps finish 
off the mood of this room elegantly.

This small hallway is rather quiet the crackle of burning wood and the
smell of cedar reminds one of paradise.  To the north is an elaborately
shaped, white spruce, pine door with a engraved silver door-knob.  To
the south is a simple wooden door, with a glass window about halfway up
the doorway.  The hall continues to travel off to the east passing by a
few offices before coming to a dead end, and off to the west towards a
four way intersection before approaching the Player Relation's section
of the Staff Halls.

The small hallway comes to a sudden hault due to a large wall being built
along the eastern side of the room.  The crackle of burning wood fills the

elevator doors, and to the south is an gigantic metal door that has a large
selection of different types of locks.  The grand hallway continues to run

With floor to ceiling glass to the south, east and west, the only wall of 
this room is the northern one which has white wallpaper with golden 
designs. An mahogany door is set in the northern wall, with a large glass 
window in it facing the hallway. Above, round white lamps made of frosted 
glass hang at whimsically differing intervals from the ceiling. Through 
the three glass walls, the blue sky and a garden of varying plants are 
visible.

plant~
Just beyond the door a clay pot (painted black -- an unexpected neutral amid 
the blues and wood of the rest of the room) holds what appears to be a fake 
hibiscus plant, adorned with five brilliant blooms, their orange and red 
petals like sparks of fire amid lush green.  Upon closer inspection, though, 
it becomes apparent that the plant seems not to be affected by gravity, 
either; the leaves and flowers stand at attention, proud of their beauty and 
brilliance.  How strange.

E
artwork~
Two paintings have been placed against the east and west walls, facing each 
other across the center of the room.  They don't seem to have much of a 
subject.  One is a cerulean splash of paint thrown against white canvas that 
resembles (vaguely) a melting rose; or is that a weeping stick figure?  The 
other is a monochromatic pattern of blues: various deformed geometric shapes 
against a solid background, dancing a crazy fandango across the painting.  No 
initials or labels have been placed on the "art," so they must not be done by 
anyone famous (as though that would come as a surprise...).

Carved from ancient rock, this room is both large and wide. The floor is 
covered by a plush black carpet while the walls have many tapestries

chair pushed to the side. A bed on the opposite wall for someone to sleep 
on in case work gets exhausting. On the wall next to the bed a weapon rack 
is hung from the wall. It's displaying many daggers that have been 
collected over the years.

the spares of C.T.A.  A rather large black marble desk hovers in the
air infront of a comfortable looking black leather chair.  The only

A quiet parlour, the fireplace in the southwest corner emits a bright glow,
from a dark, blue flame. The crackle of magical wood fills the air along
with the smell of smouldering cedar. To the north lies an elaborately
shaped, white, spruce, pine door. The door-knob is made of engraved silver.
Looking up, the ceiling can not be seen.  There seem to be no bounds to the
upper space in this room.  Several birds which seem to be on fire circle above.
Occasionally one will spontaneously burst into flame, showering the floor with 
ash.

Ugh! Cobwebs litter the cluttered closet, which feels extremely 
cramped with 3 tall shelving units filling in the walls. Each shelf 
is full of supplies, with some like brooms, refill cleaning fluid, 
porter sticks and other logistic supplies. The right shelf holds 
some peculiar bookends and a few big manuals, and the floor looks 
like pure dirt and dustbunnies. Strangely enough, a shiny bronze 
pole extends from the ceiling into the floor.
A small tunnel leads to the south through the bookshelf, into darkness.

Floppy disks, bones, broken furniture and treasure are strewn across the 
floor of the chamber. Dried blood is splattered across everything, a trail 
of it visible towards the opening of this lair. The only thing that seems 
to have been spared destruction is a pool of crystal clear water and an 
oak desk. On the desk stands an old buggy windows 95 computer with a

A Large Basement Study~
A cement staircase leads down into a rather large room that resembles a 
prison cell more than anything.  The walls, floor and ceiling are all cement, 
maintaining decent insulation that gives the room a breezy coolness not 
entirely uncomfortable.  Papers and pencils lie in a hectic craze about the 
floor, scribbled over with notes and grids.  A few pieces of graph paper have 
been taped against the back wall, showing off a formidable map that doesn't 
seem to cover much real space.

papers pencils~
Loose papers lie across the floor in piles and alone: notebook paper, sketch 
paper, graph paper.  Most of it is blank, but some of the lined stuff has 
notes and maps scribbled across them, each labeled neatly with the words 
"Gorj Uluk" -- apparently the resident's latest project.  Pencils of various 
colors and stages of use are strewn across the floor, probably having fallen 
from the desk and rolled to their current positions.
~

graph paper map~
Against the west wall, three large pieces of graph paper have been taped side 
by side, each labeled in a crisp cursive hand: "The Goblin Fortress Gorj 
Uluk."  They go in order from top to lower level, each drawn square 
representing a room, its vnum labeled as crisply as the area name, only now 
in red ink instead of black.  The arrangement of the area, as well as that of 
the maps, signals the work of an obsessive compulsive...  That could be both 
good and bad.

keeps it a relatively nice temperature however. To the east the path continues down 
the mountain, and to the west it spirals upwards. A small tree is just near the 
entrance on the eastern side. A small dwarf sits at the foot of the tree watching 
something bright a littles ways towards the western pathway. A giant orb is here 
covered in what looks to be mostly blue with big sections marked green and a flimsy 
white mist surrounds all of it. A sign sits infront of it marked 'Do Not Touch'. 
Snow begins falling a little ways down each path.

on a wall there is but one painting, that of a beautiful pink flower. It 
looks like a lotus but the tips of the petals curl out like a rose just
